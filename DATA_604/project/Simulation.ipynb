    "Very recently US gas stations were hit a ransomware attack that cause mass panic. You can read the full story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-22/colonial-pipeline-is-sued-in-proposed-gas-station-class-action). The goal of this project is to show how a ransomeware attack causes longer wait times.\n",

    "![](flow_chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The gas station has a limited number of gas pumps that share a common fuel reservoir. Cars randomly arrive at the gas station, request one of the fuel pumps and start refueling from that reservoir. A gas station control process observes the gas station's fuel level and calls a tank truck for refueling if the station's level drops below a threshold. If a randomware attack happend the refueling speed drops to represent a slow down."
