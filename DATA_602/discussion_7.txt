1. What are the benefits of using numpy? Why use it?
Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python.
Numpy is better than a python list.

Size - Numpy data structures take up less space
Performance - they have a need for speed and are faster than lists
Functionality - SciPy and NumPy have optimized functions such as linear algebra operations built in.

2. Create an empty numpy array.
np.empty(10)
3. Create a numpy array with all 0's.
np.zeros(10)
4. Create a numpy array with all 1's.
np.ones(10)
