Kenan Sooklall - Syntax/Logical Errors

This code wouldn't run due to the missing test3 for the third test score.

Also the calculation of the average is a logical error meaning the code will compile but the results will be incorrect.

The correct way to compute the average would be (test1 + test2 +test3)/3. I believe the last print statement should be in the if statement due to the content of the text.

If so, that would make it another logical error.
