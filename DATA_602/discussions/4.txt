Kenan Sooklall - Conditional statements

1. functions are an essential part of programming - Why?  (Guiding questions: What are the benefits of functions?  How would not having functions impact your coding?).

Functions alow us to reuse code in different parts of our script. They save a lot of time from repeating ourselves. Functions help organize our code into blocks and allow us to parallelize expensive operations.

2. Conditional statements allow you to incorporate choices in your programming.  How and why is this useful?
Conditional statements such as if statements are at the heart of how programming became useful to society. The ability to threshold a value before sending it to the clients is necessary for checks.

The mailroom has asked you to design a simple payroll program that calculates a student employeeâ€™s gross pay, including any overtime wages. If any employee works over 20 hours in a week, the mailroom pays them 1.5 times their regular hourly pay rate for all hours over 20.

I had some fun with this one

employees = input('How many employess as integer: ')

hr_rate =[(int(i.split(',')[0]),int(i.split(',')[1])) for i in [input('How many hours did you work and at what rate ex(20,15): ') for i in range(employees)]]

pays = [20 * rate + 20 * 1.5 * (hours - 20) if hours > 20 else hours * rate for hours,rate in hr_rate]
