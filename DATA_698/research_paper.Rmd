### Introduction

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. According to the WHO diabetes has entered the top 10 causes of death, following a significant percentage increase of 70% since 2000. Diabetes is also responsible for the largest rise in male deaths among the top 10, with an 80% increase since 2000. Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect insulin production and use. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can’t produce insulin. The cause isn’t known. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, or insulin can’t be used effectively. Type 2 diabetes can be caused by a number of factors, including poor diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight.

### Data Analysis

The data set was obtained from UC Irvine and contains 101766 rows and 50 columns. The patient column contains 71518 unique patients. To avoid over fitting on a single patient all duplicated patient data was dropped leaving the data set with 71518 rows. The 50 columns can be broken down in to 5 parts, admission data, lab diagnosis, patient details, diagnosis data and diabetic drugs, Table 1.

The data set has "?" to signify a missing value, so "?" were replaced with NaNs for all columns. The weight, payer code and medical specialty were dropped for having too many NaNs. Drug columns examide, citoglipton and glimepiride-pioglitazone were dropped because they only had 1 unique value.
Encounter ID was dropped as it doesn't provide any informative information. Finally race was dropped as it might make the model not useful and can lead to misinformative result.

The target column readmitted was transformed with NO as 0 and all other values as 1. This remapping transforms readmitted from 3 unique values to 2, changing this analysis to binary classification.
