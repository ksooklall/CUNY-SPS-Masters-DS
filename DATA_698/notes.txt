T2 Diabetes

Pancrease secreates insulin in to the blood stream when sugar levels are high.
Beta-cells freely take in sugar from the blood stream and when levels get too high they secreat insulin into the blood

Glucose is toxic at high levels
Glucose can be stored in the liver, fat(adopose) or muscle

The average person has 5L of blood in the body, 4.5g of glucose/5L is normal, 9g+ is diabetic
