  \begin{abstract}
  Type 2 diabetes is a disease that affects many around the world and
  continues to cause wide ranging problems. In this paper three models
  with various combinations of features that involve patient admission
  id, diabetic drug use, lab data and others were trained to predict the
  probability of a patient being readmitted. The results enforce the
  difficulties of making predictions with patients affected by type 2
  diabetes. The first two models have an F1-score of 55\% while the last
  got to 60\% on the test set. Age always played a large role in
  predicting readmission followed by A1C result and blood glucose level.
  Diabetic drugs Metformin and glipizide Many were determined to be
  important in a patient being readmitted. The initial cause of the
  hospital visit, ie. emergency, trauma, were determined to be the most
  important variable.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. According to
the WHO diabetes has entered the top 10 causes of death, following a
significant percentage increase of 70\% since 2000. Diabetes is also
responsible for the largest rise in male deaths among the top 10, with
an 80\% increase since 2000. Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect
insulin production and use. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can't
produce insulin. The cause isn't known. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas
doesn't produce enough insulin, or insulin can't be used effectively.
Type 2 diabetes can be caused by a number of factors, including poor
diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight.

Throughout this paper diabetes is a shorthand for type 2 diabetes.
According to the source the dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of
clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It
includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.
The data contained information that satisfied the following criteria. It
is an inpatient encounter (a hospital admission). It is a diabetic
encounter, that is, one during which any kind of diabetes was entered to
the system as a diagnosis. The length of stay was at least 1 day and at
most 14 days. Laboratory tests were performed during the encounter.
Medications were administered during the encounter.

The data contains such attributes as patient number, race, gender, age,
admission type, time in hospital, medical specialty of admitting
physician, number of lab test performed, HbA1c test result, diagnosis,
number of medication, diabetic medications, number of outpatient,
inpatient, and emergency visits in the year before the hospitalization,
etc.

\hypertarget{preprocessing}{%
\subsubsection{Preprocessing}\label{preprocessing}}

The data set was obtained from UC Irvine and contains 101766 rows and 50
columns. The patient column contains 71518 unique patients with 28784
readmitted and 28781 not readmitted. To avoid over fitting on a single
patient all duplicated patient data was dropped. Then downsampling was
conducted for the minority class leaving the data set with 57568 rows.
The 50 columns can be broken down in to 5 parts, admission data, lab
diagnosis, patient details, diagnosis data and diabetic drugs, Table 1.

The data set has ``?'' to signify a missing value, so ``?'' were
replaced with NaNs for all columns. The weight, payer code and medical
specialty were dropped for having too many NaNs. Drug columns examide,
citoglipton and glimepiride-pioglitazone were dropped because they only
had 1 unique value. Encounter ID was dropped as it doesn't provide any
informative information. Race was dropped as it might make the model not
useful and can lead to uninformative result.

The target column readmitted was transformed with NO as 0 and all other
values as 1. This remapping transforms readmitted from 3 unique values
to 2, changing this analysis to binary classification. The age column
was bucketed into young (age\textless30), adult
(30\textless age\textless60) and old (age\textgreater60) then one hot
encoded.

The diagnosis columns diag\_1,2 and 3 were mapped according to the icd9
codes, then one hot encoded. The drug columns were mapped NO as 0 and
all other values as 1. The only NaN rows were diagnosis, so they were
all dropped as imputation is not possible.

Admission type ID, Discharge disposition ID and Admission source ID were
mapping according to the source paper with a few major changes.
Discharge disposition ID was reduced to ``other'' , ``home'' and NaN.
Admission source ID was reduced to ``emergency'', ``referral'',
``other'' and NaN. Admission type ID was not changed from the source
except replacing NULL and not available with NaN.

Columns to great interest are glucose serum test result and A1c test
result. Glucose serum test is a numeric value that measures blood sugar
level, a value of 126 mg/dL or higher indicates the patient is diabetic.
The A1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells that have
sugar-coated hemoglobin, a value of 6.5\% or above indicates the patient
is diabetic.

\subsubsection{Exploratory Data
Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

The data set is slightly skewed with 42982 (60\%) patients not being
readmitted and 28533 (40\%) readmitted. Gender is well balanced at 53\%
male and 47\% female. Age is skewed more toward the older population,
which is expected for a disease that is more common in the older
population. All other numeric variables follow a similar distribution.

There is a weak relationship with drugs taken and a patient being
readmitted. The only drug with a high readmission is insulin which is
expected since insulin plays a major role in a patient becoming
diabetic. Figure 1 shows that most of the readmitting comes from older
individuals. The older population is represented the most and the
younger population the least. Figure 2 shows that A1C results greater
than 8\% have a big affect on readmission; however, for patients who
didn't get readmitted there are a lot of adults with A1C results of
greater than 8\%. Figure 3 shows a big spike for normal glucose levels
for both classes. There is also very similar levels of all age groups
between both classes. For both A1C results and max glucose serum the
younger portion of the population contributed the least to readmission.

Figure 4 shows how time in hospital is right skewed with no distinction
between classes. Figure 5 and 6 shows the number of lab procedures and
number of medications are normally distributed with the former having a
spike at the start and the ladder being slightly right skewed.

\hypertarget{modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Modeling}\label{modeling}}

Three models SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were
trained with cross validation using different combinations of features.
Model hyper parameters were tuned with grid search. The dataset was
split into training and testing with the test set containing 15\% of the
data. The best models were fitted to the training set with the best
parameters and then feature importances are plotted. Numeric columns
were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
deviation thus having a mean of 0 and std of 1. All other columns were
fed into the model without further processing unless specified. After
trying many combinations of features 4 specific sets stood out.

The first model is trained on a using all features, lab data, drug data
and patient data. This model includes gender, old, young, adult, time in
hospital, num lab procedures, num procedures, num medications, number
diagnoses, diabetesMed, change, max glu serum num, and A1Cresult num.
Max glu serum num, and A1Cresult num were engineered to become binary
with 0 as normal and all other values as 1. The training set contained
48931 patients and 8636 for testing.

The second model focused specifically on A1C levels. All rows with NaN
values for A1Cresults were dropped and then the A1C column was one hot
encoded for the 3 unique cases. Along with A1Cresults age, gender and
insulin were used in this model. The training set contained 48931
patients for training and 8636 for testing. For this model the training
set contained 8492 patients and 1499 for testing. The third model
focused on A1C leves along with blood glucose levels. All row containing
NaN for both A1C and max glu serum were dropped leaving only only 207
rows for training and testing. This very small dataset produced the most
extreme results. The final model focused on the drug columns. Since no
rows were dropped the sample size is the same as model 1 except it had
21 features.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsubsection{Results}\label{results}}

The results from cross validation produced very similar scores for all
architectures but random forest produced the best score most of the
time.

The results of the model 1 from Table 1 show higher recall for the
positive class and higher precision for the negative class. The high
recall states the model is good at catching false negative so if the
model predicts that you won't get readmitted it's more likey to be
correct. The higher precision over recall for the negative class states
the model is good at catching false positive. Model 1 has higher
f1-score for the positive class. The feature importance in Figure 7
shows highest importance with the admission type id followed by number
of diagnoses. These feature importance makes sense since an admission
type id of ``emergency'' and having a lot of diagnoses intuitively
correlate to a patient being readmitted.

Table 2 and Figure 8 show the results of model 2. The importance of age
played a very strong role for this model, almost twice as important as
the importance of being young. A1C result and gender play a much smaller
role. The classification report doesn't show any metric that stand out.
The F1-score for the positive label is 6 points higher than the
negative.

The results for model 3 are expected when the sample size is so small.
From table 3 we see 0 for both precision and recall for the negative
label. If this model predicted a patient won't be readmitted it
shouldn't be trusted at all. Likewise the recall is 100 for the positive
label with the precision at 65, stating this model would be accuracte if
it predicts the patient will be readmitted. The feature importance,
Figure 9 tells a strange story. Glucose greater than 200 has the most
importance but high A1C levels are at the bottom with age being in the
middle.

Finally model 4 has similar results as model 2 except recall is better
for the negative class. The drugs glipizide and rosiglitazone were the
most import according to Figure 10. Change being the second most
important does have some intuitive reasoning. A patient that is already
on diabetic medication being readmitted and then changing their
medication is more likely to return.

\hypertarget{dicussion}{%
\subsubsection{Dicussion}\label{dicussion}}

Diabetes is a very complex disease and this analysis has shown how
difficult it is to predict and manage once a patient is positive. The 4
models build from various combinations of features produced slight
better predictions than flipping a coin. Model 2 and 3 produced
non-intutitavely results, we would expected very high blood glucose
level (\textgreater300) and very high A1C results (\textgreater8) to
play the strongest role; however they didn't. One explination could be
that the patients passed aways before being readmitted. Figure 1 showed
that most of the dataset comes from the elderly population so it's very
possible. Having such high results over the age of 60 is more
detrimental to one health as opposed to an younger person.

Other features like time in hospital, num lab procedures, number
diagnoses and num medications didn't play as large a role as what we
would have expected; however the Figures 4-6 did propose that fact.

Furthermoer the four models trained here are by no means the best use of
the dataset nor were they exhaustive. Along with different combinations
of features and feature engineering more results could be found.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

According to the mayo clinic type 2 diabetes is disease in the way the
body regulates and uses glucose as a fuel. This long-term (chronic)
condition results in too much sugar circulating in the bloodstream.
Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the
circulatory, nervous and immune systems. Although there are many
diabetic medication metformin and glipizide showed large importance
followed by insulin. The reason a diabetic patient goes to the hospital
is the most important factor iin determining if they will be readmitted
in the future.
