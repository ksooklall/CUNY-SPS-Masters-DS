  \begin{abstract}
  Type 2 diabetes is a disease that affects many around the world and
  continues to cause wide ranging problems. In this paper three models
  with various combinations of features that involve patient admission
  id, diabetic drug use, lab data and others were trained to predict the
  probability of a patient being readmitted. The results enforce the
  difficulties of making predictions with patients affected by type 2
  diabetes. The first two models have an F1-score of 55\% while the last
  got to 60\% on the test set. Age always played a large role in
  predicting readmission followed by A1C result and blood glucose level.
  Diabetic drugs Metformin and glipizide Many were determined to be
  important in a patient being readmitted. The initial cause of the
  hospital visit, ie. emergency, trauma, were determined to be the most
  important variable.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsubsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. According to
the WHO diabetes has entered the top 10 causes of death, following a
significant percentage increase of 70\% since 2000. Diabetes is also
responsible for the largest rise in male deaths among the top 10, with
an 80\% increase since 2000. Diabetes is a group of diseases that affect
insulin production and use. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can't
produce insulin. The cause isn't known. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas
doesn't produce enough insulin, or insulin can't be used effectively.
Type 2 diabetes can be caused by a number of factors, including poor
diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight.

Throughout this paper diabetes is a shorthand for type 2 diabetes.

\hypertarget{preprocessing}{%
\subsubsection{Preprocessing}\label{preprocessing}}

The data set was obtained from UC Irvine and contains 101766 rows and 50
columns. The patient column contains 71518 unique patients with 28784
readmitted and 28781 not readmitted. To avoid over fitting on a single
patient all duplicated patient data was dropped. Then downsampling was
conducted for the minority class leaving the data set with 57568 rows.
The 50 columns can be broken down in to 5 parts, admission data, lab
diagnosis, patient details, diagnosis data and diabetic drugs, Table 1.

The data set has ``?'' to signify a missing value, so ``?'' were
replaced with NaNs for all columns. The weight, payer code and medical
specialty were dropped for having too many NaNs. Drug columns examide,
citoglipton and glimepiride-pioglitazone were dropped because they only
had 1 unique value. Encounter ID was dropped as it doesn't provide any
informative information. Race was dropped as it might make the model not
useful and can lead to uninformative result.

The target column readmitted was transformed with NO as 0 and all other
values as 1. This remapping transforms readmitted from 3 unique values
to 2, changing this analysis to binary classification. The age column
was bucketed into young (age\textless30), adult
(30\textless age\textless60) and old (age\textgreater60) then one hot
encoded.

The diagnosis columns diag\_1,2 and 3 were mapped according to the icd9
codes, then one hot encoded. The drug columns were mapped NO as 0 and
all other values as 1. The only NaN rows were diagnosis, so they were
all dropped as imputation is not possible.

Admission type ID, Discharge disposition ID and Admission source ID were
mapping according to the source paper with a few major changes.
Discharge disposition ID was reduced to ``other'' , ``home'' and NaN.
Admission source ID was reduced to ``emergency'', ``referral'',
``other'' and NaN. Admission type ID was not changed from the source
except replacing NULL and not available with NaN.

Columns to great interest are glucose serum test result and A1c test
result. Glucose serum test is a numeric value that measures blood sugar
level, a value of 126 mg/dL or higher indicates the patient is diabetic.
The A1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells that have
sugar-coated hemoglobin, a value of 6.5\% or above indicates the patient
is diabetic.

\subsubsection{Exploratory Data
Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

The data set is slightly skewed with 42982 (60\%) patients not being
readmitted and 28533 (40\%) readmitted. Gender is well balanced at 53\%
male and 47\% female. Age is skewed more toward the older population,
which is expected for a disease that is more common in the older
population. All other numeric variables follow a similar distribution.

There is a weak relationship with drugs taken and a patient being
readmitted. The only drug with a high readmission is insulin which is
expected since insulin plays a major role in a patient becoming
diabetic. Figure NUM shows that most of the readmitting comes from older
individuals with high A1C results, with 1200+ patients have greater than
88\%. Surprisingly some adults and youngsters who were not readmitted
also have high A1C results, greater than 8\%.

Figure NUM shows how time in hospital is right skewed with no
distinction between the target. Figure NUM-NUM shoes the number of lab
procedures and number of medications are normally distributed with the
former having a spike at the start and the ladder being slightly right
skewed. As seen from Figure NUM the number of diagnoses has a spike at 9
with more individual being readmitted, after that the count is less than
20.

Figure NUM doesn't show a distinction between age and glucose serum test
for those who were readmitted. The older population is represented the
most and the younger population the least.

\hypertarget{modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Modeling}\label{modeling}}

SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier were trained with
cross validation using different combinations of features. Model hyper
parameters were tuned with grid search. The dataset was split into
training and testing with the test set containing 15\% of the data. The
best models were fitted to the training set with the best parameters and
then feature importances are plotted. Numeric columns were standardized
by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation thus
having a mean of 0 and std of 1. All other columns were fed into the
model without further processing.

The first dataset used all features, lab data, drug data and patient
data. - features: gender, old, young, adult, time\_in\_hospital,
num\_lab\_procedures, num\_procedures, num\_medications,
number\_diagnoses, diabetesMed, change, max\_glu\_serum\_num,
A1Cresult\_num - num\_cols = {[}time\_in\_hospital,num\_lab\_procedures,
num\_medications,number\_diagnoses{]}

The results produced very similar scores for all models with random
forest producing the best. The results of the random forest are in Table
NUM and feature importance in Figure NUM. The number of lab procedures
and number of medications played the strongest role in model prediction
followed by the time in hospital. These features make intuitive sense
since someone how is taking a lot of medications and has to stay in the
hospital for extended period of times will be someone that might return.

The second dataset contained all features that were determined to be
important through the exploratory data analysis except the drug columns.
Again there was similar results with model performances. The features of
importance are shown in Figure NUM. Age and gender have the lowest
importance while A1C result and glucose levels were the highest.

The last round of modeling is done with glucose serum test result and
A1C test result as those are the features that a patient can control
through diet or exercise. Age was also added to this dataset to see if
it plays a bigger role. The dataset was filter for rows that only
contain values for both features leaving 208 rows. Both glucose serum
test and A1c test results were one hot encoded.

\subsubsection{Results and Dicussion}\label{results-and-dicussion}}

Diabetes is a very complex disease and this analysis has shown how
difficult it is to predict and manage once a patient is positive. The 3
models build from various combinations of features produced slight
better predictions than flipping a coin. The last two models show that
managing A1C results and blood glucose levels play a very important role
in being readmitted. Another important variable that we have no control
over is age.

Other features like time\_in\_hospital, num\_lab\_procedures,
number\_diagnoses and num\_medications didn't play as large a role as
what we would have expected; however the eda did propose that fact. When
all features were used the reason for admission and discharge scored the
highest in feature importance.

The last model highlighted the importance of age even if one has good
control of their A1C and blood glucose. Although it's not explicitly
stated the process of a patient passing away after initial admission
(readmittiong = 0) explain the initial skewness of the data.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

According to the mayo clinic type 2 diabetes is disease in the way the
body regulates and uses glucose as a fuel. This long-term (chronic)
condition results in too much sugar circulating in the bloodstream.
Eventually, high blood sugar levels can lead to disorders of the
circulatory, nervous and immune systems. Although there are many
diabetic medication metformin and glipizide showed large importance
followed by insulin. The reason a diabetic patient goes to the hospital
is the most important factor iin determining if they will be readmitted
in the future.
