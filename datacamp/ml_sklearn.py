Regularization I: Lasso
In the video, you saw how Lasso selected out the 'RM' feature as being the most important for predicting Boston house prices, while shrinking the coefficients of certain other features to 0. Its ability to perform feature selection in this way becomes even more useful when you are dealing with data involving thousands of features.

In this exercise, you will fit a lasso regression to the Gapminder data you have been working with and plot the coefficients. Just as with the Boston data, you will find that the coefficients of some features are shrunk to 0, with only the most important ones remaining.

The feature and target variable arrays have been pre-loaded as X and y.

Imputing missing data in a ML Pipeline I
As you've come to appreciate, there are many steps to building a model, from creating training and test sets, to fitting a classifier or regressor, to tuning its parameters, to evaluating its performance on new data. Imputation can be seen as the first step of this machine learning process, the entirety of which can be viewed within the context of a pipeline. Scikit-learn provides a pipeline constructor that allows you to piece together these steps into one process and thereby simplify your workflow.

You'll now practice setting up a pipeline with two steps: the imputation step, followed by the instantiation of a classifier. You've seen three classifiers in this course so far: k-NN, logistic regression, and the decision tree. You will now be introduced to a fourth one - the Support Vector Machine, or SVM. For now, do not worry about how it works under the hood. It works exactly as you would expect of the scikit-learn estimators that you have worked with previously, in that it has the same .fit() and .predict() methods as before.
