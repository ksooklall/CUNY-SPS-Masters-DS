LM and GLM

Here is a quick summary of LM and GLM models

LM - Linear model like linear regression

    - Normal errors, constant variance

Equation

y = a + bx + e
where a,b are the coefficient, e-error

GLM - Generalized Linear Model

  - Non-normal errors, non-constant variance

Equation

log(y) = a + bx + e -> y = exp(a + bx) + e -> y = exp(a)*exp(bx) + e
GLM is multiplicative but still linear since the exponent is a linear model (a+bx)
