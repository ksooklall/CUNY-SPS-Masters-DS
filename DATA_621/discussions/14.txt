Basic Panel Data Analysis

This video on linear regression https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQvhi60yN74 is an amazing explanation for panel data analysis

The first comment on this video explains it all:

This is the best lecture I have taken about the Fixed effect. You are better than any other econometrics professors I have met. Thank you so much for your crystal clear explanations.

The professor breaks down how his model goes from a simple

Linear Model - y = b0 + b1*x

to a more complex one

Individual fixed effects model - y = b0 + b1 * x + F_i + T_i

where F and T are other predictors.
