Robust Regression

OLS is very sensitive to outliers, a few data points can cause the regression line to become steeper that expected. In such datasets Robust regression might be a good strategy since it is a compromise between excluding outliears entirely. The idea of robust regression is to weigh the observations differently based on how well behaved these observations are. Roughly speaking, it is a form of weighted and reweighted least squares regression.
