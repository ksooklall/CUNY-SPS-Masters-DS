The TSNE Plot
The TSNE plot is a dimensionality reduction technique which is a way to graphically simplify very large datasets. Within seqmonk it can be used to cluster data stores on the basis of the current quantitation across a large number of probes.

Conceptually the TSNE plot is similar to a PCA, but with some important differences:

TSNE always produces a 2D separationk, in contrast to PCA which can produce many different components
TSNE is non-deterministic, meaning you won't get exactly the same output each time you run it (though the results are likely to be similar
TSNE tends to cope better with non-linear signals in your data, so odd outliers tend to have less of an effect, and often the visible separation between relevant groups is improved
TSNE offers no ability to reverse engineer the groups it identifies so in contrast to PCA you can't make a probe list based on the separation you see
