  At first, I was very happy with this product. It mixed well and tasted great. Honestly, I'm happy to please, and none of the protein powders I've ever tried have made me unhappy. After making my way through the 5 lb. container over about 20 days, I began to get gritty, strange particles that did not mix - maybe a teaspoon full. As of today, I made my way to the bottom inch of the container, and found my protein bottle almost 1/4 full of disgusting, gritty, play-dough-like pieces that would not mix, dark brown/black bits, and HARD plastic-like pieces. After investigating further, the rest of my container is full of almost nothing but that material. None of it dissolved, no matter how long I mixed it. I even put it through the blender on HIGH for a minute! I never write reviews, bad or good, and am typically pretty understanding, but that's just awful. I've tried at least 10 different whey Isolates over the years. I've purchased an estimated 200+ pounds of whey protein in my lifetime. I have to say, my experience this morning was horrific! But now its been over 30 days, and I have no recourse for a refund. At the very least, Nutricost does not have good quality control, and if a company can churn out a product like that, god knows what they're letting pass through their factory. If you pick through the other reviews, you will find some similar to mine - some even have photos of what I suffered through. I'm not the first this has happened to, and I clearly won't be the last. Be careful - you may have done fine with this product before, but sooner or later, you'll end up with sand, play-dough, and plastic in your mouth! What a shame...

  It tastes kind of milky still. It has the slightest light vanilla milky-ish flavor. When I mix it in with other things (crystal light or a fruit juice) it's barely noticeable. If I mix with just water I have to use at least 16oz of water for 1 full scoop to dilute most of that milky-ish protein flavor.I'm underwhelmed but it's a high amount of protein (30g) per scoop which makes me happy when I don't want to drink a cookies-n-cream or strawberry mousse or lemon tea flavored protein drink all the time.I'm going to attempt to mix it in with and sprinkle on top of different foods to see how ""unflavored"" it is with those things.I don't know if I'd repurchase since there are so many other whey isolates from other brands to try out BUT it's going to take me a long time  (probably 2 months) to get through this 5lb container.November 2019 Edit: it's grown on me...maybe 3.5 stars now. Still have about 1.5lbs left of it. I alternate with this and Isopure though (I like Isopure's unflavored isolate a bit more).

  I found and have been using this brand of protein for the last year and felt like I found THE go-to protein.  When I first started purchasing in 2017 both the vanilla and chocolate had ZERO clumps and would dissolve completely with one or two shakes.  Now in December 2018 there is noticeably more clumping and grit.  I fear there has been more artificial flavors added or diminishing product quality.  It is sad and because of this they might be losing once was before going to be a permanent customer.

  I read some reviews about some lumpiness or dark clumps in the product. I've received 4 containers so far and have not found anything like others have described. Possibly a batch issue?

I use about 1 container every month to 6 weeks. I also make the mix with Almond milk and use it over about a week with no issues there. Kept in the fridge as well.

  I swear my muscles don't hurt as much and seem to be stronger since taking this protein supplement.  I don't know if it's the placebo effect or what.The reason I bought this brand is that it is cheaper than the other brands (which seem to charge you extra for the pictures of massive, steroid-induced muscles on the containers) and because in the questions and answers, the company stated they make sure there are no excessive amounts of toxic metals in their protein mixes -- which is a real problem with protein supplements.  Especially plant-based supplements.  I stopped taking supplements once I found out but since this one is monitored for toxic metal content, I started using it again.

  I have been buying Nutricost Unflavored Protein Isolate for more than a year almost every month. I thought the value to quality was great until what I saw inside the bottle (see pics). Towards the end of my last bottle, I saw this big, hard, caramel colored chunk of thing that scared at first and made me wonder what I have been putting in my stomach all these times. It may have been a defective product and it can happen due to bad quality control but no thanks. I have to switch to another product even it is more expensive...

    Inexpensive, Doesn't bloat/cause weight gain, Fairly tasty

  Ok so I really need to write a review for this stuff. I have been using whey protein for a little over a year now. I've purchased all kinds. Some of them expensive, some of them while on the go at the supermarket and some on a budget. This one by far is my favorite so far. Starting with the positives: for price per weight, this brand is inexpensive compared to most. I love that! What's more, I don't get bloated or gain weight on this stuff. I am always looking after my macronutrients and making sure I get a specific amount of fat, protein and carbs for my hardcore fitness lifestyle. Now with some of the other non-isolate brands, I not only became bloated but I gained weight; most likely due to the extra carbohydrates in them. I am very cautious about where my carbs come from and so that's why I decided to go with isolate. Anyway, this Nutricost whey protein isolate doesn't bloat or cause extra weight gain for me. As far as mixing, I've never just mixed my protein powers by hand. I've always used my handheld blender. This stuff blends up nicely in my blender. I just blend it with water, drink it frothy and I'm happy. Negative: There was a better-tasting yet more expensive whey protein isolate brand that I was purchasing for a while, but it became too expensive for my family and I. With Nutricost's vanilla protein isolate, it has a good flavor but not the very best flavor. But for the cost, I'm just fine with the flavor! It's good enough to drink and that's all I care about. I now have a giant 5lb container of this stuff and I'm as happy as a clam because with my grueling workouts, I'm finally starting to see my abs with this stuff.

    LACTOSE INTOLERANCE
  
","









  
  
    
  This review is for those that are lactose intolerant. The product is labeled as an isolate which is supposed to contain virtually no lactose. I usually consume three servings a day, one with each meal. With one shake I experience very little to no symptoms. With two I begin to get gassy, and with the third I am getting very uncomfortable and extremely gassy. This leads me to believe that the product purity is not as claimed and has a good deal of whey concentrate. Since I purchased a 5lb tub, I went ahead and bought some lactase pills to help digest the remainder. Since lactase isn't cheap it must be considered as part of the cost of this whey. As such I cannot recommend this, since you are better off purchasing a more pure isolate instead.As for the protein powder, it mixed good with just about any liquid I used (soy, almond, water) and tasted good. My recovery times also seemed consistent with other brands protein. This maybe a good buy for those that don't have a lactose intolerance but I would be cautious if you do.

  I ordered the 5 lb vanilla. In the past, I've used Body Fortress protein isolate, but I thought I would try this since the cost is far better. I generally combine it with almond milk in a jar and shake it with the lid on to mix it. With the other brand, part of the protein powder would always stick to the sides of the jar, and I would have to scrape it with a spoon to get everything blended. With the Nutricost protein, however, it mixed very quickly with little effort and no need to bring out the spoon. The taste may not be quite as good as the other brand, but it's pretty good nonetheless, and especially for the price, I'm very happy with it.

    Nutrition Label Falsified
  
","









  
  
    
  They say 30g of protein per 30g of isolate.  Look at any reputable vendor that goes into detail (like bulk supplements).  27g per 30g of isolate.  I can see nearly 0.5g of minerals on the label, in similar concentrations to other vendors of whey protein isolate; so it's unlikely they've produced a more pure product as additional purification would remove those minerals too.  So therefore the most likely explanation is: the label is Falsified.  I hope they haven't Falsified in other ways; like adding steroids, muscle building supplement manufacturers do that sometimes.

The company obviously changed the recipe of their protein and I'm pretty sure it's for them to save money.  Well, I didn't see any savings passed on to me.  I'd much rather have the protein back to what is was and mixed nicely in a shaker.  What a waste of 50 bucks...UPDATE:  I returned the bottle I wrote about hoping it was just a defective bottle and got another shipped to me.... much to my dismay, the second bottle was exactly the same.  I was so happy with this brand for so long.... I hate shopping for protein, but I will definitely take my business elsewhere.  happy hunting people!!!

But, this is annoyingly sweet and artificial tasting.  So far, I haven't found a way of mixing it that works for me.  I've tried it in water (both cold and hot), hot chocolate , coffee (both cold and hot) and I can't find anything this works well in.Which is disappointing since I really liked the plain flavor from this company.  If you're trying to decide between the two... I personally would recommend the plain.  I'm glad I only got the 2lb bin because I'm going to have a hard time finishing it.I gave 3 stars because the plain whey was good, and assuming they use the same protein, the quality of the protein itself should be the same.

  Anybody who is educated in supplements & nutrition will tell you proper information therefore any label that doesn't state it's protien blend within the nutrition facts box is illegitimate and markets protien thats non effective which 96% do. There's a box for a reason and thats the only part of the label thats 100% regulated by FDA. Blends stated outside that box. Omit formulas not stated, fda gives companies cost cutting permissions within there legal policis to use outside labeling to bend corners & deceive consumers by non transparent labeling to endorse non effective supplements for there own financial gain. Heat processed whey protien when consumed disrupts the molecules in the body thus destroying the labels professions stated of what it says you get due to its heated yeild counteracted in your body. Cold processed as claimed within the fact box yeilds 80+ thus getting full benefits of a pure protien. You do not need 1 gram per pound. Advertisements convince the ignorant for creating a market for whey protien & so unnecessary consumption. Body builders suffer consumption because the stomach is unnaturally forced to consume lustful amounts against its godly ability to brake it down.

Sometimes I have an extra one if my wife hasn't cooked dinner, or if she's ""cooked"" but it's really just vegetables.

  This is by far the best whey isolate I've have ever use. I'd been working out for years and have used dozens of protein powder. For the prices this can't be beat. You get a high quality product for a price that is lower than most isolate on the market. I use a blender bottle and it dissolve smoothly and best part about the unflavored is that you can change up whatever you feel like making that day. I haven't use it long enough to see the result but I will update if it didn't go well.  Thanks Nutricost hope ya'll keep the prices this low for the future.

  I been using many different whey isolates over the last 25 years. Occasionally I by a product based on price hoping to find the perfect protein with a lessor than standard price. Like most lesser expensive products you end up “getting what you paid for”. The Nutricost Whey Isolate fits that statement. It’s not a throw away, but the taste and after taste are substandard.

I am on probably my 8th or 9th 5-pound tub and they are still claiming zero grams of sugar per serving in the description/page photos, but every single tub has read 2 grams of sugars per serving when I receive them.That's dishonest. How complaints do you need to make the correction? How long does it take to fix the photo if it is an honest error?Not happy with that. Therefor, one star until that gets updated.

  The product is nice, true to the Description  unflavored or rather very light flavor (you can taste it if mixed with water) I use it more for a quick mixed drink with light flavorings (vanilla, teas and coffee) in my blender bottle however if I put in a blender it tends to get to foamy and it wants to separate...But overall the powder is nice quality and it's a great deal

  This is great protein because it doesn't have all the added sugar and flavor boosters (empty calories) that most mainstream proteins have. Hence the scoop is much smaller. Plus the aftertaste is minimal. I mix it with some PB2 and water. Doesn't taste amazing but that's because it's a protein shake, not a chocolate milkshake. Will definitely buy again.

  I remember first seeing this and getting excited because of how good of a price it is. Though, I would've been better off saving my money. First of all, it tastes great in the beginning. However, my body slowly began to absolutely repent it. I would literally have to hold back from throwing up after drinking it after a month or two. That's not at all an exaggeration, either (and I'm in full health with a very strong stomach/not picky).My brother also experienced this too, after purchasing it. After a while, I just stopped using it and was totally turned off by the idea of protein powder because that's what I thought every brand would be like. Recently, I started buying another brand off of GNC and ended up actually saving more money because of the many sales they offer.

  This the 5th time I’ve bought whey protein powder/isolate and this is by far the best I’ve had. Going into this, i was expecting it to clump up in mixes or Taste weird, but it didn’t! It is truly unflavored, so i can mix it with whatever i feel like at the time. Normally i mix a scoop with some mixed berries, water, and a bit of agave syrup and it tastes just like a normal ice cream smoothie would! I even tried mixing it with water just to test how well it really mixed, and it didn’t change the texture at all. It is great to have 30g of protein per scoop, and this is probably the best deal i have found for protein powder. Will definitely be buying again!PROS:  - Mixes extremely well, even works with water  - Doesn’t affect flavor of drinks, actually unflavored  - Doesn’t change the texture of drinks  - Much higher density than most other options  - One of the most affordable optionsCONS:  - Not really any i can think of...I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a good unflavored protein powder or isolate.

  It shakes well, it's inexpensive, it tastes fine, it's pretty low in calories, and has a great volume/grams-of-protein ratio.  It's all you could ask for in a whey protein.  Can't speak to the quality of the protein since I don't have my own lab (which is sadly the only way to know what's really in nutritional supplements), but I've been able to drink a couple scoops in lieu of a post-workout meal and haven't lost any muscle, so it must be doing something.  Super happy with this purchase.

  Ive been lifting weights for over 15 years.  I started off drinking every heavily marketed protein shake and found out through the hard way that not all proteins are manufactured equal.  Many companies out there claim their proteins to be high quality but when lab tested, fail or are shown to lie.  Labdoor.com is a great website to look at the label accuracy and purity of popular and well known brands of protein powder.  Nutricost is unfortunately not popular enough to be tested by them.  When looking at that site I have noticed that I had stomach problems and cramps from brands that scored poorly on the test results.  I ordered one of the top scoring protein brands MyProtein and for the last 5 years have ordered exclusively through them.  No stomach or side effects with their superior quality protein.  I ran out protein this week and realized that I never ordered a new bag, problem with MyProtein is your looking at a week for shipping and so I decided to order this off Amazon with prime.  I've drank 3 shakes and all 3 times, I have had gas problems and made trips to my porcelain throne.  The way my body reacts to this protein is the same way my body reacted to other low quality but expensive protein powders out there.  Now it could be something else in their powder that is making my body suffer however through my experience this is due to lower quality protein.  Also the strawberry tastes exactly like muscle tech's strawberry and their protein is some of the lowest scored protein via labdoor.

  I have tried all lot of whey powders but this might be the worst one! I had it and liked that's it's just one ingredient. But every time I drank it, I would feel nauseous!

My husband recently started having whey and he had the same issue. He never has had issues with other proteins. I was getting ready to buy another box when I saw the reviews of people getting sick. I might have to unfortunately agree and say the quality of this product is not well controlled and it may be contaminated. I brought the naked brand and I am loving it!!

  I like this product. I've bought it pretty regularly over the past year. The reason I'm giving a negative rating is because I noticed since about 3 or 4 months ago that they increased the size of the scooper that you use to measure the servings. The bigger serving size makes you run out of the product faster. Therefore you have to buy it more often. Therefore they sneakily make more money.  I will keep buying it cause I like it, but nevertheless I'm not happy about the scooper trickery.

  I cannot drink whey concentrate powders. I also have to be very careful with ingredients that can trigger my contact eczema symptoms. Glad to say this protein powder is good. I cannot comment on mixing with a spoon or shaker as I always blend this in my Nutribullet mixer and of course it mixes well. I mix this with almond milk, half a banana, ice cubes and raw oatmeal and it is delicious. You could probably add almond butter to it and get a ""peanut butter"" type taste also. I have mixed cocoa powder in with a little honey and it turned out well also. If you are planning on mixing this with a mixer before or after you workout, you will like this powder. The taste is good and it works great as a base for any other ingredients you add to change to your liking. This 5 pound container lasts me well over 2 months. I am planning on this being my go-to protein powder from here on out. Thanks Nutricost for a great product! Don't ever change it!

  I have explored many different isolate proteins mainly for a lactose intolerance issue I have. This Nutricost Whey Protein Isolate has been very easy to get along with in that department. The nutrition label is on par with the major brands and better in some cases. I always mix mine with chocolate or vanilla almond milk of the unsweetened variety and it has a very nice taste overall. In fact the taste is sweet enough to make up for skipping sweets while watching calories. If I had to ding this product on something it would be the fact that it foams up a bit when you shake it up. It does mix very well.I recommend this product highly.

  Best bargain right now for whey isolate. I gambled and bought purely off the price difference. I normally buy muscle feast or NOW and honestly this protein has a better taste (for unflavored), smells and mixes better also. It's too soon to tell since i just drank a shake, but if it doesn't give me the farts, it's 5 stars. Not sure why there's 2g of carbs per serving, but it must have to do with the filtering process. Other than that perfect.

  As a Fitness Transformation Coach I have tried many type of proteins from various brands. Over all, this whey isolate is a good value as a basic protein, for your gains.Flavor was irrelevant as I purchased ""unflavor"", however when I tasted the dry powder it does have that slight creamy/milky taste. When rubbing the powder on the fingers it feels a little more coarse than other brands I have used, but not too bad; it mixed fairly well in the water. I do like the clean ingredient of just whey isolate that gives a high amount of protein (30g/serving) compared to other brands (21-26g/serving).Cracked on arrival (see picture). Two suggestions for Nutricost, either stuff the box with recycled papers to prevent damage (if keeping the price low is your strategy), or invest in better material container (the current plastic feels low quality).

  Whey protein. Plain and simple. Has a slight milk taste if you mix it plain with water but does not take away from other ingredients in a smoothie and doesn't have an aftertaste. No problem with clumping and nothing strange found in the container like I saw in a few reviews. I'm thinking that may be a problem of the flavored ones. 3/4 down into 5pounds and no problem here. I was looking for something with no flavor so it would be versatile enough for any kind of smoothie. Also wanted something without artificial sugars or other ingredients.

After work and the gym there is not enough time and I don't have enough of an appetite or energy to get in a days worth of protein in a few hours time. I will be ordering more when I start to run low. It is hard to find products that do not have a bunch of unhealthy fillers and this product is very clean. I am sensitive to lactose and cannot handle any protein powders that are concentrate. I have no bloating or discomfort with this product. I add unsweetened almond milk and Ultima Orange electrolyte powder to this and it makes an amazing tasting drink.. almost like an orange Julius.

  I bought this because: 1. the cost is lower than other whey isolates; 2. it's unflavored (usually I find flavored stuff to be too sweet or chemically tasting); 3. its made in the USA; 4. the ratings from Amazon users are generally positive. I just got my shipment today, and made up a shake before going on a bike ride. I kept it simple for the first time - I put a scoop in a half-size cocktail shaker with about 6 oz. of whole milk and gave it a quick shake (see the attached photo).The powder mixed up fine; a very small amount of it remained at the bottom - didn't get mixed up in the shaker - but I think I can avoid that by stirring the mixture a bit with a spoon before shaking. The taste was fairly neutral - something like good-quality powdered milk.  I'll try adding my own flavorings next time - fruit, jam, etc.Protein = 30g per scoop, 6g +/- for the milk = 36g (about the same as 6 eggs.

  First and foremost, very simple group of ingredients with the core being whey protein isolate. It's tough to judge other protein products on the market because index blend of proteins. There isn't an easy way to measure the ratios of isolate protein. So I'm applauding this company for 30g of whey protein isolate per scoop. Second, for me is mixability. This product is extremely easy to mix and does't leave clumps in your shaker - put it to the test. Third, the taste on the milk chocolate is very good with it not being over powering. I'd put it up there with the elite with my favorite being Syntha 6. It does have Sucralose which is most popular in the form of Splenda. Would have preferred Stevia here. The 2g of sugar is not added so I'm assuming it's from the Cocoa which contributes to the taste. Lastly, you're not going to see a big index for BCAA or Aminos. This is because of the 6 ingredient simple profile. Personally, I get those from food but if you're worried about it you can get a bigger dose from supplementation that focuses on BCAA/Amino opposed to a protein powder product arguably.

  Had some reservations for this product as I've never tried it before and when I see something cheap I'm just skeptical from a get go. I did some research on isolates and found this product with some really good reviews so I decided to give it a try. I ordered two small 1 lb tubs of chocolate and vanilla to try it out. Chocolate flavor is very good even with just plain water. Has a great sweet taste. doesn't clump if you shake it good. A lot better than ON products in my opinion. I haven't even used it in my blender for a smoothie, just in a shaker bottle and so far I'm happy. I have not tried vanilla yet so we'll see but I do recommend chocolate.

  Product came as described. Unflavored ""whey protein isolate"". The price is right. Looks like protein powder. Product label doesnt have an amino acid profile included. It seems like a given that one would want to know the AA profile of the protein they are using to ensure protein synthesis is acheived at a given amount of product used. I feel like it isnt listed because they have something to hide perhaps. Other brands do list it however. So I think next time Ill spend the extra and buy from a brand that lists the AA profile. For anyone curious the AA profile is probably the most important bit of information you could have when selecting a protein powder. Second to grams of protein per serving...

  I would describe the flavor as good, not great.  But it is an incredibly high-protein powder, without the enormous amounts of fat, sugar, and/or cholesterol found in so many other powders.  I mix 2 scoops with 2 cups of non-fat milk, ice, and one tablespoon of peanut butter, and it is delicious.  Further, because of the lack of sugars and fats, this powder is only 140 calories per serving.  So if you are looking to gain lean muscle, (which means lifting hard, eating clean, and consuming a large amount of protein to rebuild), this is the perfect powder for you.

Oh and it mixed well with hot broth too, so I will be trying out in my coffee.Update: So it's been a week and I've used this unflavored daily in my coffee so YES it does mix well in coffee too!

  Wow! This protein is my new favorite. It is everything I've been looking for. Great taste, great protein content, whey isolate, low sugar, great mixability, smooth (lump free) drinkability. It reminds me of the Isolate ice cream chocolate flavor powder which I used to buy all the time, from another company until they apparently went out of business and the product was no longer available. This is also an excellent value for a whey protein isolate powder.

  For me the ultimate test is how easily it mixes up. This whey is good at dissolving into whatever you blend it with. Flavor good. 30g of protein per scoop...I personally mix with 8oz of skim milk so I really dont even need a full scoop seeing how the 8oz of skim has 8g of protein and your body can only metabolize 30g an hour so I know I'm getting the max protein per shake that my body will allow. Good whey overall.

  This stuff tastes great! it mixes exceptionally well, its got a high protein content per serving and it's cheap to boot! This is seriously the #1 best value protein powder supplement on all of Amazon. No matter what it is that I buy from Amazon, I take my time researching each and every product before I buy it so that I get the best product possible for the most reasonable price possible! Please notice, I did not say cheapest price possible. IF I wanted the cheapest price I would probably end up with crappy product 9/10 times.... but you cannot go wrong with this protein purchase, unless of course you don't like vanilla or no matter what you just don't like protein powder.Some other notes:I have recently been trying to lose some weight and that is infinitely harder without my local gym being open. I am not the type of person who goes on a diet, EVER... I like milkshakes and Icecream way and I mean WAY too much. Like breakfast/lunch/dinner/before bed snack/midnight snack too much.... seriously... I even mix protein powder with my milk shakes...I did give up the milkshake diet in order to decrease the covid-19lbs I put on....SO as part of my keto BHB + apple vinegar 3pill breakfast each morning, I have a triple scoop one of these shakes, with 10oz skim milk, nice and thick is the way to go.  It easily tides me over to lunch. probably 3 days a week I will have another 2-3 scoop shake for dinner, and a small light snack before bed (usually yogurt+granola). It has been almost 3 weeks and  I'm almost back to my size 33"" waist (down from a size 36"" stuffed to the brim, probably closer to a 38"").during this time I have had 3 different protein powders. this one was the cheapest of the 3, the only one of the 3 that was not a name brand and happened to be the tastiest as well as the most effective. please notice once again, exercise was not listed in my routine. not that I dont do it (ok, well i dont really), but my job is now pretty much my desktop pc for 10 hours a day....the combo of the keto pills + apple cider vin pill + this protein = weightloss extreme!Definitely worth spending your money on this. and here's a clue for any other guys out there who are trying to lose their own covid-19lbs.... all you need to do to lose the pounds is pack on the protein and dont worry so much about the fats you're consuming, but definitely watch the carbs. I dont eat many carbs as it is, so avoiding them isnt difficult. But if it is for you, i say find a way to (or an amount of) substitute this protein for whatever your bane is. Protein is the key for males to losing weight easily and quickly. it literally drops off. Some days all i have is this shake,... 3 or 4 of them (always a minimum of 2 heaping scoops often 3 heaps). i never mix it with milk more than twice in a day, so if i have 3 or 4, I use water for the last two. This might be bad for me...but whatever, it works. just make sure you drink plenty of water, this stuff makes you thirsty anyway so it shouldnt be a problem.  and as a side bonus, doing normal fix-it stuff around the house has like double or triple the effect on muscle growth. my lady couldnt be happier...flat tummy again and spinch-eater's Popeye arms!

I cant have milk so water is all ive got. Also, its not like sugar sweet, it taste artificially sweet. I hate that.Bottom line, i'll finish it and keep looking for something else. I'd stick with ON if they werent too pricey. Maybe i'll try the non flavored one if everything else fails.

  I've been working out for 30+ years and have tried an immense number of protein powders, bars and various other supplements. I've recently been more focused on purchasing whey isolate instead of the various blends out there (in the past, I focused largely on grams protein/serving, taste, how it mixed, etc.). I did not know what to expect from this brand given the relatively low cost for isolate....I was REALLY impressed. While other brands may excel in taste (but also high in calories and a bunch of additives), I found Nutricost's taste very good, not overly sweet. Also, it mixes quite well. I simply mix in a standard shaker bottle after my workouts at the gym and have had no issues. When you wrap this all together with the price, I would call it a GREAT overall value. Again, very impressed. Based on my experience with their whey isolate, I recently ordered their BCAA powder....waiting to test it out.

  This stuff does not clump up at all. It's so strange. Unflavored is good as it is when you have fruit for a smoothie but as is, the taste isn't that great. I prefer Chocolate myself and it's great for people with lactose intolerance.Update for Salted caramel ->>>Good news: this is pretty darn tasty, tastes slightly like a Whataburger Salted Caramel milkshake. Price was decent.Bad news: this is pretty sweet, disgustingly sweet because it uses 2 sweeteners (sucralose/splenda and acesulfame potassium.) Tastes good at first but then the sweetness just keeps building until it leaves a hint of that ""diet/artificial"" taste. But then again, other isolate proteins also use sucralose or acesulfame k in their flavored versions (e.g. Myprotein, ON Isolate) but those protein powders cost a ton more compared to this.Overall: Not bad. If you like sweet stuff, this is probably for you. I've only used the unflavored stuff till now which is why I say it's pretty sweet. Best alternative to making it less sweet is using half a scoop from unflavored and half a scoop from the salted caramel in my shaker bottle. Works pretty well.

  This review is coming from someone who has tried MANY isolates and powders over the past years in bodybuilding and powerlifting.VANILLA ISOLATESMELL- 9/10- its vanilla.... I would give a ten, but you have to leave room for improvement.SHAKER BOTTLE TEST - 9/10- came out smooth, not clumpy, even with very cold water. Keep in mind i did not use milk, so results may vary.BLENDER TEST - 10/10- I always make milkshakes when I can and this came out perfect. Ice, little cinnamon, little milk.. bam, fluffy cold shakeINGREDIENTS - 10/10- nothing better than looking at the label and seeig FIVE ingredients... and the fact that you can pronounce all of the names. No crazy  additives and blendsVALUE - 10/10- Whey isolates are not cheap. They have ranged anywhere from 28-36$ for me in the past for 2 LB containers. The fact that this is 24$ PLUS the fact it can be purchased in a 1 LB container is amazing, that way you dont have to get a 2LB if you just want to test it out.After years of looking around for a protein powder that is not harmful on my wallet and on my stomach - due to all of the endless amounts of  additives - I have finally found it. Thank you Nutricost.

  Product arrived with powder on the outside. Figured It was from the factory or seal was broken. Latter was true. When I opened it the seal stayed with the top. This shouldn’t happen. To my surprise there were black and brown stains on card stock seal and the foil was torn. I suspected mold at first but changed because there seemed to be a burnt smell. After smelling closely the burnt smell was confirmed. Aha! Too much heat used during the sealing process burned and compromised the packaging. Please fix this. Turn down the heat, don’t leave it under the heat for long or both. Shoot, change factories for all I care. But based on reviews, stuff like this started happening in 2019 where it wasn’t happening before. Not good for my first experience as a customer and for company reputation, especially given that it’s still happening mid-2020.I want to try and like this product but can’t now. Sucks because now I have to spend more money on protein for the next couple of days. Please make this right.

  I saved money on this unflavored whey isolate but my wife had a couple of problems.  It is priced very well and we detected no off flavor so I consider it 5 Stars.  We are using initial purchase.  My wife has focused on the cholesterol level which I think is acceptable and quite low.  She thinks otherwise (because our former product was half of this).  The biggest problem we have is the large size and the need to transfer it to a much smaller container we store in refrigerator.  The money saving was welcome but it appears I will bow to wife's desire to return to our regular item which is 1/4 the size although more costly.  For our family, convenience and micro-management of one ingredient has prevailed.

  So this is really not as isolate as you would think. The flavor is closer to what concentrate would taste like. And you don't have to trust my tastebuds to know this is a mediocre product. Just look at the label, you see those 2 grams of sugar? well those 2 grams of sugar come from Lactose, and that's why it tastes more like concentrate. Real isolate protein powder is almost tasteless and has negligible lactose. I know this because I am actually lactose intolerant, and this product makes me sick if I don't take lactaid.Save your money and buy concentrate if you don't mind about the lactose, it is cheaper and less processed. If you mind about lactose get a different product.

I make a shake using ice cubes, banana(frozen) and 1/2 whole milk. 1/2 water and the Nutricost and it taste pretty good. The best tasting brand in my opinion. I must have had 8 or so different brands in my life, and this is definitely the top or right there.I see my body changing with exercise and the Whey to help build my muscles. It mixes great in my blender and I have tried 8 brands over years and this is in my top 2 easily. I purchased it after searching for WHEY ISOLATE and stumbled upon it and said ""What the heck, might as well give it a shot."" I think I found my go to brand of Isolate Whey.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this product due to the value and the taste. 6 months into the product and it is still something I use near daily to meet my needs. My body feels great and a big part of it is hard work(1 mile of walking/jogging and some wreights) and the use of this product.
