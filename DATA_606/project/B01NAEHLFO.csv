  I love the double chocolate flavor. Tastes like good chocolate milk and no artificial sweetener taste. I tried a small 2lb container to see if I would like it before getting the 5lb container and I'm glad I did. I would hate to be stuck with a huge container of protein I didn't really like. I like to mix this with Oatmilk (or almond milk) and drink this after my workouts OR use it in a smoothie to help me reach my calorie goals for the day. Oatmilk has like 110 calories per cup which is one of the reasons I really like it.  Other proteins I have tried have given me the runs or not blended well, but this one works for me.

  I am use to getting BSN products which I like a lot but I thought I’d try something new. Since this Optimum protein is popular I figured I’d give it a shot. So far I don’t like it at all. The chocolate taste is very poor, you can barely taste any chocolate in it when drinking. The powder doesn’t mix well at all and it still leaves chunks of powder stuck in the bottle after drinking. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone and for the future I’m definitely sticking with BSN protein which is overall much better.

  I've been using ON products for years, and had moved to some of their other whey offerings lately. I decided to go back and use some Gold Standard for a while. Upon returning I (now) remember two important things:- Gold Standard is a much better value vs. the higher priced ON whey offerings like hydrowhey/hydrobuilder- Gold Standard doesn't mix quite as well as the hydrowhey/hydrobuilder (and because you use less of it per serving, tastes less creamy)There are many times I'll mix one scoop gold standard whey (chocolate or strawberry) with one scoop gold standard casein (vanilla or banana). The casein mixes a bit thicker than the whey, and the combination results in a pleasing blend/texture/taste.In any event, if you're looking for a good value, high quality product - this is it.

  VALUE: At the time of my purchase in early 2013 this was one of the best dollars-to-pounds ratios of whey protein out there. For $100USD you get ten pounds of whey. Ten pounds of most other whey products would cost $150 to well over $200 (I'm looking at YOU Jay Robb Enterprises). Even my other favorite whey protein,

  , had to be ditched for the value that Optimum Nutrition's ginormous ten pound bag of Gold Standard Whey provides.FLAVOR: Double Rich Chocolate - Awesome taste, not medicinal, metallic, lingering, or otherwise yucky. It's one of the only protein powders I've had that I can mix with spring water and not gag on, or be forced to chug. If you're a skim milk kind of person, it's going to taste so good that you think it's your cheat day. If you use 1% milk, well, that kinda IS a cheat day, and it tastes like a milk shake.CONSISTENCY: It mixes well in milk and water. I have a

   container and it merely takes a few swishes to get about 95% of the powder mixed. However, keep in mind that this *IS* whey we're talking about. Whey is sticky and clumpy no matter what. If you mix it just before drinking it, you'll have some gobs to deal with. If you mix it, let it sit for an hour, then mix it gain, it'll be smooth. This protein also works well with other micronized supplements. I regularly mix creatine and glutamine into it and they all play nicely together.TEXTURE: It's silky and not grainy or mealy. I mix one heaping scoop per one cup of water. It will collect on the bottom of your container, even after just ten minutes. Expect to twirl the drink around a bit before drinking it if you sip on it between workout sets. My daily routine is to mix four scoops in four cups of water. I have one cup in the morning, two cups during my weight lifting, and one cup at night. I always have to swirl it a bit, but It's always smooth.NUTRIENTS: Each scoop has 24 grams of protein and 120 calories. That's pretty lean; the leanest possible calorie amount for that many grams of protein being 96. Ten calories are from one gram of fat. I've read that this makes it 81% protein by weight per serving. There's only three grams of total carbs. There are four grams of glutamine and glutamine precursors for muscle repair, so factor that in if you supplement with extra glutamine. There are also 5 grams of BCAAs in the form of Leucine, Isoleucin, and Valine. It uses sugar alcohol based sweetener to reduce calories, so beware if that's something you're against and pass on this for something with stevia instead.PERFORMANCE: I've been using four scoops of Double Rich Chocolate each workout day, five to six days a week. I have seen big gains. It's hard to pinpoint where the gains are coming from exactly; the different workout regimen, supplements like creatine, a larger and more protein packed diet, or some other combination. I think each thing has its own effect, and this protein plays a large partMISC: Can be used as chock blocks for single engine aircraft. Excellent ballast in the trunk of your car in icy or muddy conditions. Don't show up on rally day without it. Includes home defense possibilities, assuming you can heave it far enough at an attacker. Also good for squats and deadlifts when you can't find your barbell.CONS: All of the above are the pros. The only cons I can see are the calories and the artificial sweeteners. It's not the barest bones protein you can find, if that's what you're looking for. The sweetener thing might rustle some people's jimmies, but most folks will be fine with it. For what it is, I don't think you can find any better testing, lower calorie whey protein on the market.

  The powder dissolves quickly, tastes pretty good (I have only used it in water; it would likely taste better in milk), and is a good value if you are only using it for weight loss.  For weight loss, you use about a scoop or two maximum per day.  That means the container will last you 1-2months.  If you are looking for muscle building, however, you might need twice as much, making it pretty expensive (one container used up in less than one month for ~ $55).  I have not been using it long enough to vouch for any results, but as a diet supplement, it works well.

  I NEVER write reviews here, but after trying this I just had to. This is the best whey protein powder I've ever tried and I've had some pretty bad ones. I ordered the double rich chocolate flavor and mixed it with some milk after my workout and it tastes just like chocolate milk. It mixes very well and doesn't leave those nasty chunks some other powders do. I'm very happy with the taste and consistency of this product!!!

  Well I have tried many types of protein shakes and can not stand ANY of the flavors. I gave this a 3 out of 5 stars due to some imperfections, but taste wise I would give it easy 5 out of 5.Pro's:-Taste exactly like Nestle Milk Chocolate that you buy pre made in those bottles. Very good. (When mixed with milk)-This comes with a lot of powder.-Mixes Excellent with a shaker.Con's:1) If you try to mix it with a spoon, fork, or any other method you get gross powder chunks that are impossible to mix.2) If not mixed with a shaker or blender, almost undrinkable due to chunks of powder.3) Does not go well with water at all.If you use milk, which you can easily do. This will be a great shake for you. Water mix with the shake, I would not use this product.I highly recommend you drink it in the morning with milk when you wake up, have another round of it sometime in the day, im sure your work has a fridge you can store milk or something. For me, I work out late at night after work (around midnight) so I will get home and drink it after working out.Take my pro's and con's into consideration.

    Real facts on whey protein
  
","









  
  
    
  If you are performing a great deal of intense exercise it is a good idea to supplement good nutrition with some protein shakes. However, it is a common mistake to think that supplements will provide magic results, when in fact they only account for a small percentage of the total results (I would say no more than 10%), provided your training and nutrition are good also. I lift weights 5 times a week and have had good results supplementing with ON Whey Protein. I have two shakes a day, one first thing in the morning the one after my workouts.The product itself is great. Very clean and pure protein, low-calorie servings and good taste. I have tried Vanilla Ice Cream, French Vanilla Creme and Double Rick Chocolate. The flavor is something of personal preference but I have noticed that the Vanilla flavors are slightly easier to dissolve in liquids. However, if you use a blender (please do so) you should have no problems with any flavor.

  I wanted so badly to like this product, but here we are. Most recently I'd been using Vega's protein powder but once I finished it I decided to make a switch since the stevia in it was just too much. After starting this powder I've made a vow to never again purchase protein powder with stevia. Because true to form, the stevia in this powder is maybe even more overpowering. There's almost nothing you can do to mask it- I've tried it all. Further, the ""chocolate"" flavor is nonexistent. The only thing this powder has going for it is that it's not that chalky. The texture suits me just fine; the taste doesn't. On the plus side, this product is really going to keep me motivated to work out. Because the more I work out, the sooner I'll be done with these ghastly sweet drinks.

  Of all flavors and brands Whey proteins I've tested, Double Rich Chocolate ON Whey stands on top. Normally taste is inversely proportional to its health benefits. Not true for this product. Mixes well with water and milk. Works great as pre, post and intra workout. For regular workout-aholics there, this becomes a staple after some time for its taste and convenience. Wish I can buy a larger amount(e.g. 10 lb) at a lower than current price point. At present ON has reached at a point, where they can easily skimp on marketing and packaging and purely rely on customer reviews and deliver quality product at a lower price(e.g. Bulk Supplements)

  I know it's pretty expensive, but I haven't found any other whey protein that's actually all protein. Everything else comes with unnecessary carbs and fats. If I want more carbs, I'll mix it with milk. If I want more fat, I'll use 2% milk.

  I don't really have much to compare ON whey protein to because it is the only protein that I have used since starting to workout a year ago. It tastes great. It can be a little difficult to dissolve sometimes but like I said, I don't have a basis for comparison. I recommend the double rich chocholate because it isnt quite as sweet and I add dextrose to my post workout shake, which sweetens it up quite a bit.

  As a non scientist, I usually just buy whatever tastes or looks the best. This product hit a home run in both categories. I credit Gold Standard Whey for me being strong enough to give my dad's friend a black eye after he kept touching my David Backes jersey. I was like dude stop touching me but he kept touching it and trying to turn me around like I was his slave so I just turned to my dad and was like is your friend trying to take me home tonight or what?Well he wouldn't have any of that - when I walked away from their discussion where they were probably praising Bush's actions in the Middle East or trickle down economics my dad's friend Mr. FUHRER (I mean cmon, do you hate this guy yet? Decided to come at me from behind and put me in a headlock. I was pretty drunk at the time but was able to break free and punch the dude in the face. What an idiot. Why would somebody attack someone who consumes Gold Standard Whey daily? The dude got a black eye. His job is to get people to sign up for 401ks - I wonder what his stats were for that next week?

I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into protein powder.  I've noticed quite a few changes to my body too since adding to my diet and exercise routine.

  I am use to getting BSN products which I like a lot but I thought I’d try something new. Since this Optimum protein is popular I figured I’d give it a shot. So far I don’t like it at all. The chocolate taste is very poor, you can barely taste any chocolate in it when drinking. The powder doesn’t mix well at all and it still leaves chunks of powder stuck in the bottle after drinking. Overall I wouldn’t recommend this product to anyone and for the future I’m definitely sticking with BSN protein which is overall much better.

  ON Gold Whey is known for high quality protein and was part of the protein absorption testing and was shown to be high quality, but there are lots of high quality protein powders.  I think the main factors for picking a protein powder are: does it mix well and does it taste good.ON does mix very well.  I mix with 2% milk and I can use a shaker and no clumps are in the bottle.  I've even mixed this in a pinch by stacking two cups together ala Cocktail and it came out blended.The taste is decent and better than most I've had.  The only thing that put me off initially was the consistency.  Using one scoop with 8 oz. milk the mix is still very liquid.  I've been used to having a thicker texture with this type of ratio, so it was a bit off putting.  But, I've grown used to it and it's actually nice since you can finish off the shake and not have much left clinging to the sides.

  I usually buy my protein powder from GNC but I finally decided to purchase them from amazon due to the low cost. I purchased 5 pounds of the double rich chocolate which proved to be a horrendous mistake. Firstly, I could tell it was not sealed tightly as it made a huge mess when I opened the container. Secondly and most importantly, the formula tasted awful, I don’t know if it is a bad batch or if they changed their ingredients but the double rich chocolate I’ve been using from GNC had some flavor. This one was disgusting, there was no hint of chocolate and I felt very unpleasant after drinking it. I was basically drinking water with a bad aftertaste. Do not buy the double rich chocolate or you’ll regret it, now I’m stuck with 5 pounds of useless powder.

  Ok, so i NEVER write reviews, just because i dont have a lot of time. But i had to write one on the Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey. I got the the Double Rich Chocolate flavor, because many reviews i read said it was the best. And... It is great! Tastes just like chocolate milk. I could drink it as a dessert, but its really good for you. Ive been blending it with 8 oz of milk, 3 ice cubes and a banana. Sooooo good. Anyway, thats it. Ive tried a lot of different protein powders and shakes and this is by FAR the best. Thanks!

  Of all flavors and brands Whey proteins I've tested, Double Rich Chocolate ON Whey stands on top. Normally taste is inversely proportional to its health benefits. Not true for this product. Mixes well with water and milk. Works great as pre, post and intra workout. For regular workout-aholics there, this becomes a staple after some time for its taste and convenience. Wish I can buy a larger amount(e.g. 10 lb) at a lower than current price point. At present ON has reached at a point, where they can easily skimp on marketing and packaging and purely rely on customer reviews and deliver quality product at a lower price(e.g. Bulk Supplements)

    EVERYONE should take whey, and this is delicious...in milk
  
","









  
  
    
  I thought this stuff was pretty nasty at first. Even after shaking it up well and diluting 1 scoop with 10 oz skim milk, it still had a bad aftertaste and I had to gulp it all down at once. After a couple of weeks, this stuff started to taste great, like real chocolate milk, which I know a lot about since that's one of my favorite drinks. It's creamy and delicious, I love it. The only thing is that you can't just shake it up and pour it into a glass. You have to keep shaking it every time you take a sip. If you choose to spoon stir it, it's even worse - you have to stir like crazy, take a sip, and then stir again, otherwise it comes out of solution.I was once out of milk and had to drink this stuff in water. I've never drank out of the toilet, but there is not a doubt in my mind that toilet water would be tastier than this stuff in water. Make sure your fridge is always stocked with milk.

    Turn your morning coffees into Protein powered Mochas!

  We have used this protein for two years now, I favor the natural vanilla flavor for daily and post workout smoothies mixed with coconut milk, blueberries, Acai and Maqui concentrates but my wife prefers this double chocolate.  It's great stuff and we have transformed and sculpted our bodies with improved diet and exercise over the last 2 years to a degree I would never have believed as we are 58 and 60 years old.  We're now in better shape muscle and weight wise than when we were 40 or maybe even 30, we use this as a protein boost nearly every day.A while back we gave up the last of our regular sugar consumption by eliminating it from our morning coffees.  I really didn't enjoy it black and unsweetened and one day I thought to add the ON.  Not bad!  We now mix the double chocolate with organic whole milk or half and half into our coffee with a few drops of stevia liquid.  Fantastic!If you add the protein powder directly to hot coffee it tends to clump pretty badly. The way to avoid that is to add the milk first to your cup then a HEAPING teaspoon of powder which easily mixes into the milk, then add the hot coffee and froth with the Aerolatte.  It's slightly sweet as is or you can add a few drops of stevia liquid concentrate.  I don't like to eat in the morning,  I have tried bulletproof coffee but I much prefer this, 2 cups in the morning and I am good until 11 or 12 when it's time for bacon and eggs and the full protein berry smoothie.The Aerolatte is invaluable for mocha's and cappuccinos: http://www.amazon.com/Aerolatte-56AL3SAT-Milk-Frother-Satin/dp/B0002KZUNK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415916668&sr=8-1&keywords=aerolatte

    The king of whey protein shakes
  
","









  
  
    
  First time trying the double rich chocolate. I was hesitant because if some reviews saying it tasted terrible. Those people are just probably used to McDonald’s milk shakes cause Gold Standard taste is supreme. I’m a female weight lifter and I drink two shakes of gold standard a day. My favorite is natural vanilla. It’s light and sweet, easy to throw back. The DR chocolate was the only one available so I thought I’d bite the bullet and give it a try. Amazing as usual. It has a light sweet flavor. Mixes well with water and easy to throw back. Kind of has a cocoa powder taste with a hint of natural sweetness. I love it. I have tried other brands and they are thick, chalky and over sweet. Gold standard truly is the best and a long time reputable brand.

  I've been using this for a week and I like it so far. It dissolves nicely in both water and milk (using blender bottle), and leaves me feeling sated afterwards. Smells a little odd in the jar, but tastes decent for a protein mix.Serving ideas:- Don't use more than 8 oz of water or it tastes really thin.- Try using warm/hot water for a ""hot chocolate"" like experience.- Add a heaping teaspoon of cocoa powder to each serving to make it more chocolatey. (It's too sweet by itself for me.)- Mix with milk instead of water for a thicker drink.- Add a shot of espresso for a pre-workout protein mocha!

It can be a little difficult to dissolve sometimes but like I said, I don't have a basis for comparison. I recommend the double rich chocholate because it isnt quite as sweet and I add dextrose to my post workout shake, which sweetens it up quite a bit.

  So much that is positive has been said about this product that I thought I'd mention that it tastes good.  I tend to be sensitive to artificial sweeteners, but my gut is okay with this one.AARP just (Oct.'18) published an article on the diet that is essential to seniors.  We're to eat protein with every meal and  with our snacks.  This protein, along with physical activity, will help to stave off muscle loss.  Their article made good sense, so I am following their advice: eat lightly and eat protein along with enough fiber.  I therefore doff my proverbial hat to a whey protein powder that tastes like a chocolate milk shake.  Yes, it's yummy.  I suspect that you'll like it, too.

  Been taking it for a few weeks and I think the taste is OK, i normally just use it to make chocolate milk for a quick 40g of protein after a workout which is pretty nice. Its definitely not NesQuik or anything and it gets chunky even when i try to mix it well but I tried making it into a shake and it was a bit tastier.Still if your used to that Avg, Whey protein taste this is an amazing source of quick protein and I definitely noticed how easy it is to fill in my requirements for protein.

I purchased this product about a month ago and have added it in at least once or twice a day.  I can't speak about results yet as Im still early in my training plan, however I can say that this product is easy to drink!  I was worried that these protein drinks would be horrible, but have found that this one is easy on the taste buds.. and can be mixed with a spoon in water if you don't have a shaker cup handy.

  I've also been a customer of ON for over 10 years, but recently bought a tub of the Vanilla flavor and something tasted very off about the formula. It had a strong artificial sweetness to it and was a lot harder to stomach than any of the protein shakes I've made in the past. After waking up the next morning, I had some of the worst diarrhea I'd ever experienced and spent the entire day constantly having to run to the bathroom multiple times per hour. Reading some of the other negative reviews on this site confirmed a lot of my worries, as they listed the exact same experience as me.Overall I'm just really bummed. I don't know why they would change the formula to something so grossly inedible, and I have to go back to experimenting with different brands to find a new favorite now.

    The New Mix Tastes Terrible and is Actually Bad For One's Health
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been using ON Gold Standard Whey for over 10 years as it had great taste, good protein content and was cost effective. Two years ago, I switched to another brand because of the flavor and similar price point. That company eventually disappeared and so I switched back to ON. I bought a few bags from Costco. Upon tasting it I realized that they have now changed the formula and use Sucralose, which makes the powder taste ultra sweet and very artificial. I would even go far as to say that it tastes just disgusting. Moreover, in a new article by the Washington Post, they state that Sucralose actually makes you gain weight and feel sick (Google ""A common artificial sweetener might be making you fatter and sicker, a new study says"").I returned all the unused bags back to Costco and have now ordered one bag of the Double Rich Chocolate as it seems that it doesn't contain Sucralose. If it does, it is being returned. It is really surprising that ON would choose to put this ingredient in a health drink mix, especially given the article's findings. I also messaged them on Twitter, but they don't want to respond. ""Great"" customer service.

  Of all flavors and brands Whey proteins I've tested, Double Rich Chocolate ON Whey stands on top. Normally taste is inversely proportional to its health benefits. Not true for this product. Mixes well with water and milk. Works great as pre, post and intra workout. For regular workout-aholics there, this becomes a staple after some time for its taste and convenience. Wish I can buy a larger amount(e.g. 10 lb) at a lower than current price point. At present ON has reached at a point, where they can easily skimp on marketing and packaging and purely rely on customer reviews and deliver quality product at a lower price(e.g. Bulk Supplements)

  Taste isn't great, but from what I hear, Double Rich Chocolate isn't everyone's favorite, and that's what I got.  What I will say is it mixes well in a shaker bottle, with no clumping.  I like that it's a low calorie option, and I can make it a heavier meal if I throw in some milk, peanut butter, and a banana.If you're coming from Syntha-6 (like I did), know that this is a huge step down in flavor, but it's much lower calorie and has higher quality protein.
