  The protein was pretty good. I‚Äôd agree that the taste was in the 7-8 range. It mixed pretty well as it wasn‚Äôt thick at all. Consistency was üëåüèª. Had a little bit of a chalky texture to it, but could probably adjust the amount of water to balance that out. Overall, would probably purchase again depending on how my stomach feels in the next 20-30 minutes

  Tried the triple chocolate flavor of this product, it actually mixes a lot better than I thought it would. I put two scoops in 1 cup of milk it mixes very well.  The triple chocolate is not bad in my opinion and it does not have a bad aftertaste. MuscleTech is known for making well made products and the Phase 8 protein is no exception. I'll say that this is one of the better proteins that I have tasted from MuscleTech and I think that this product is worth the money.  The results you get from Phase 8 protein is equivalent to that of similar products from other brands, only this one is more affordable. This is a great protein for after workouts, especially with the hydrolyzed whey protein isolate and the casein protein for the slow digesting at night. It doesn't hurt your stomach like the other protein product can. I would recommended this product to my friends and colleagues.

  I have ordered several bottles of this protein now over the course of months, and i have to say for the price this stuff is amazing. it is a mix of both whey protein and casein protein. Those are the two best/most common used protein sources and since they metabolize at different rates, it helps keep protein synthesis at a higher rate all day. I really recommend this product to anyone looking for a good brand. All of the flavors i have tried have been good, i have no complaints there either. It also mixes very well with a shaker bottle, many cheaper protein powders require a blender to get rid of the chunks and to fully mix, but not this stuff. This stuff is amazing, and gets a perfect 5/5 from me

  The Phase8 powder did mix very-well with water and was very creamy when mixed with milk or milk-like products. Some protein powders do not stir together effectively but would mix better if shaken and this was the case with the Phase8. It was available in many flavors and all the flavors I tried did taste well. Taste and mix-ability all ranked high. Most of the protein products I used in the lower price point, did not mix or taste as good as the Phase8.

  The title says it all.  This product mixes well, and my stomach tolerates it just fine.

  Muscle Tech has created an amazing protein with the Phase 8 blended formula. For those who regularly workout and for those who don't, this is a must go to protein that consists of seven sources. It is low in calories and carbs compared to other proteins which make it ideal for a meal replacement shake. The blended protein definantly helps with muscle recovery.  The taste is fabulous too (well as good as a protein supplement can taste) and it mixes very well. I personally get the Vanilla flavor and mix it with vanilla almond milk - unsweetened and vanilla almond chocolate milk to change it up. I highly recommend this product to individuals looking for both a meal replacement and muscle recovery protein. Plus, Amazon has a great price on it!

  Since I generally only eat once a day at dinner, I wanted something more substantial in the morning than just my coffee, and this is my go-to daytime protein boost. In hot coffee, it's a little clumpy if it's not thoroughly mixed. I've found that it's best if I put the powder in the cup first, add a few ounces of hot coffee and stir it up to almost a thick uniform paste-like consistency, then continue adding the rest of the coffee while stirring. I generally use a large 20oz mug for my morning coffee.UPDATE - I just ordered one in the vanilla flavor and it has a bitter, chemical-tasting aftertaste - definitely not happy with the vanilla and would not recommend.

  I always read reviews on protein powders that complain about the flavor. It's a nutritional supplement, not a milkshake. It is meant to serve a purpose, not entertain your taste buds. With that said, the ones who say the chocolate flavor tastes horrible are crazy. I've tried MANY protein powders over the last decade and chocolate is always my default flavor, and this is probably the best tasting one so far. And even though it is mostly whey protein with a little casein thrown in, it does seem to keep me satiated for a long time. It also mixes way easier than pure casein, which is nice. Aside from the useless claims of ""making your muscles bigger and stronger"" and all the BCAA garbage that you get from regular food anyways, this is a solid product.

  Taste wise, this is my favorite protein powder by far. The ingredients leave a bit to be desired as we're trying to find that perfect balance of a good protein powder, taste and optimal ingredients. The final downfall is we're watching our carb intake and 8g of carb per serving is way too high for day to day.If you're objective is fantastic taste and quality whey protein, this is a stellar protein powder.On the other hand, if you're fine tuning your carb intake and seek a higher quality protein powder with minimal additives, this is not for you.3/5

  I think the Phase 8 line from MuscleTech has some of the better tasting protein blends out there.  The cookie ""chunks"" are a great addition and it helps satisfy my sweet tooth while providing a good protein boost.  I like it in the mornings for a quick breakfast and after strength training.  I am a a bigger fan of the peanut butter chocolate flavor, but cookies and creme is a good alternative. I typically use 1 scoop of powder for about 12 oz of water, but this formulation is a little thin at that ratio.  I would recommend closer to 8 oz for a better consistency and satisfying taste.

I recommend buying  the vanilla which makes a better shake with dairy product.

  I don't know how they managed it, with nothing but milk proteins, but they were able to make this a bit chalky, which just isn't pleasant for me.  The taste is VERY good, but the texture issue is a deal-breaker for me.  If the texture is okay for you or if texture is just not an issue, you'll probably love this because the flavor is just great. I used to use soy protein and until I got turned off on the texture, I liked it just fine.  There's no accounting for taste; not even mine.

    After trying several brands, I feel muscletech offers the most
  
","









  
  
    
  I've been using muscletech brand sups for years now. They always seem to have the better textures, better flavors, minimal aftertaste, lower prices, better quality, more effective supplements. I mean I've tried so many other brands. I used to mostly buy musclepharm, but honestly I feel like these products are much better. The whey protein (milk choc) has an amazing flavor and is actually enjoyable to drink. I'm a bodybuilder, and I've been able to get pretty big and pack on loads of muscle. Pretty sure this protein does nothing but help. People tend to leave reviews about sups saying things like ""who cares about the flavor, just choke it down and enjoy gains"". Honestly, after so many years of supplements, the ultimate deciding factors for me are performance, taste, and aftertaste. If you're going to ingest something daily and virtually religiously for years on end, for god sake, make sure you're able to damn stomach the stuff. Like i said, muscletech, and particularly this whey shake, is amazing. Scrumptious flavor, little to no aftertaste, easy mixing, and high quality muscle building protein.However, I will mention that every other tub of whey I encounter tends to have some strange ""hard bits"" in the powder. I have no idea what they are. Can anyone inform? @seller ?? They don't dissolve in liquid, regardless of how vigorously you shake or blend. It's kinda gross, but it's so rare that I see no reason to start the search again for another post workout recovery.

    This stuff sucks with milk

  I hate using water with my protein powder. After the gym everyday for the last two months I would make a milk based protein smoothie and this powder was terrible for it. It was too foamy. Last week I ran out of milk and made the smoothie with just water. This powder is great!  If you use water than the powder mixes really well and it is smooth. I won't buy this line again but if you don't mind using water in your smoothie this is a great product.

  This has both fast acting and slow metabolizing proteins. I do 1 1/3 scoops 3 times a day. After my workout, when I get home from work and before I go to bed. The taste is amazing and it mixes perfectly everytime. Just add 9 ounces of water and ice in your shaker bottle. I've tried many different proteins this is my all time favorite. Muscletech is the only manufacturer I trust.

  The idea of a multi-phase protein was interesting to me, so I thought that I would give this protein a shot. I‚Äôm glad that I did. The consistency is a bit thicker than other proteins from Muscletech, which is good for adding the protein to baked goods, but I‚Äôve also found adding a bit more water or milk is good to dilute the thickness of the protein. The taste is spot on without tasting cheap. This is a protein that would be ideal for those who fast because, even hours after drinking a shake with this protein, I still felt full and satiated. I intermittently fast for 20 hours. Drinking a shake with a scoop of this powder helps keep me more full for a longer period of time, making fasting a bit more easy and managable. Likewise, using this protein with fasting ensures that no muscle will be lost, as there are 26 grams of protein per serving. I usually have one scoop mixed with one cup of Fair Life chocolate milk for a very high protein post-workout shake. This is a great product and I will certainly purchase it again.

    $10 price increase from 35 - 45 within last purchase
  
","









  
  
    
  I've been buying these for awhile now. They aren't bad, strawberry was an alright flavor, but must have been selling well or something as the price just bounced up $10 from 35 - 45 since June 11th. I've tried them all and it was my favorite, for the value, but with the increase in price, I'll be alright with vanilla. Chocolate tastes like a protein bar, when mixed in water, strawberry  has a smooth texture and goes down easy, cookies and cream is pretty gag worthy, due to the chunks that are in them to attempt to replicate the ""cookies"" tastes. Vanilla is alright. I mix them all via a blender. These last about 12 or so days with four scoops a day. These aren't really supplements I sit there and think, ""this tastes wonderful."" I chug them for protein; it's a supplement. But, I have had $80 supplements that tasted like fish oil, so this is an improvement. I've maintained 180 lbs over the past 13 weeks and lost pant sizes from lifting while maintaining a calorie deficit. If the prices increase any more, it's not really worth it, as there are other supplements out there that do the trick. But, if at least one of these 4.6 lb packages stays in the $35 range, it's a good choice.As a side note, I do have to mention that the low cholesterol in this product is what I find most attractive. Some other products that I've tried ramp a cholesterol serving of 150 mg (45% DV). That's per scoop. This rocks 55 mg, (18% DV). For a guy who knows nothing of cholesterol, it makes me less paranoid.

  I'm a college student. When i first started going to the gym i was taking Muscletech Nitro Tech protein because it was convenient to buy(sold at Rite Aid). Then as i got more into it, i tried Optimum and now I'm trying Muscletech again. I have an EXTREMELY fast metabolism and I am trying this in hopes that i can take advantage of the 8 hour protein synthesis. I also made the switch back because I felt better and my muscles felt more solid after i took the Muscletech. This is the impression Phase 8 ""cookies and cream"" has given me.You need A LOT OF WATER to mix this shake. I first did the 12 ounces of water with 2 scoops and it turned to pudding/mud/cookie dough consistency. I had to mix my whole shaker cup full of water to get this to a consistency i liked, which is regular water. Then the flavor was a little weird. It was really sweet and took me by surprise. I wont say i didnt like it but i wont say that i liked it either, but i definitely didnt like the taste as much as the Double Chocolate Optimum that i had before this. But Like before, I felt immediately different after taking the first sip of the Muscletech. I really dont know what they put in this stuff, but i just get energy and feel strong. Even after leg day when I'm wasted and miserable, after my shake I can walk a half mile back to my dorm without too much trouble.Overall I think its pretty good, but I've experienced ""the gold standard"" of protein(dont hate me for sucking up to On's slogan, its pretty true). I think this is a good product and would highly recommend it. I love it but it still isnt the best i've had.

  I am a fitness instructor. Have been working out consistently for years. Have had different types of protein powder, switching it up almost every time. What I like best about this product is the price point. Can't beat that. I also like the texture/thickness of the shake. Definitely feels more fulfilling than others, especially if you use water to mix with your shakes. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is because it does feel chalky no matter how much i mix or shake it. I feel like I need to cough or clear my throat after drinking. The flavor is just okay but I dont drink protein shakes because I like the taste. Overall would recommend at least once but I dont think I'll buy again.

  No complaints about the taste, about what I expected.

  Phase 8 has a good list of ingredients but I wouldn't say that it it mixes well with anything. You can get it to mix with milk (good) water (mehj) with a LOT of vigorous shaking in a blender cup. The label says you can use 2 scoops in 14fl oz of water which sounds like it would require a lot of wrist action if that's your thing.The flavor is fine - not as good as others like Designer Protein but this is a protein shake not a delicacy. On the plus side it has a decent amount of protein and a good combo of other ingredients.

  As a 33 year veteran of the gym (I'm 73!) I think I'm somewhat qualified to offer an opinion on this product. I have made the progression from protein powder, whey protein powder, whey protein isolate, and now Phase 8 protein. It gets it's name from the fact that it contains protein from different sources, from immediate release to time release, over a period of eight hours. Make no mistake about it, there is no muscle growth without some form of protein. When you take in whey protein (the most popular form), it is gone within 30-45 minutes of ingestion and most serious gym guys work out for 60-90 minutes minimum. This product continues to feed the muscle long after the workout. There are a few good players in the supplement business (Six Star, Body Fortress, etc.) but, for my money, MuscleTech is as good as it gets. If you are like a lot of folks today money is tight but, if you could only pick one product that is absolutely essential to building muscle, protein is that one product and Phase 8 is the best product for the money. Keep lifting!

As far as muscle building effectivity and the delayed release, I would need to give it more time to see but I do seem to feel full after taking it on an empty stomuch at night when I wake up in the morning.

    High protein, low carb, BAD after taste...
  
","









  
  
    
  The reason for me buying this is that it has 26 grams of protein per scoop with only 150 calories each. Compared to what I was taking before, the Syntha 6 powder with 23 grams of protein at 200 calories, I figured the trade off is worth it. The price is what it is, but at the end of the day these giant jugs of even just decent protein powder isn't going to necessarily be dirt cheap.So that's the good part, the bad part is the taste, or more specifically the after taste. It's good first going in but when the after taste is just bitter and medicine like with a bit of Vanilla flavoring. You can KILL the after taste with a spoon full of peanut butter which makes it taste WAY WAY better than it would without it, plus peanut butter adds more protein, so as far as I'm concerned it's win win.I realize a bad after taste maybe a non starter for a lot of people, but like I said, the protein and calorie content per scoop is what I'm basing my value proposition on, so take that how you will.

  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to supplement their post-workout protein intake or use as a meal replacement because it will keep you full for hours. I prefer Vanilla because its very versatile and you can mix it with just about anything. I have added it to oatmeal, pancake mix, and throw in the occasional Oreo or two on my 'cheat days' for an Oreo Vanilla milkshake. It can have a rather thick consistency but its easily resolved by adding less ice and more water or milk. Very smooth not gritty at all. I would definitely purchase again.

","









  
  
    
  I have taken lots of protein over the last 20 years and in my opinion this one has to be one of the worst. As far as the protein itself, its a decent protein blend and I cant complain about the actual protein. The problem for me was the flavor (I used the strawberry) The strawberry flavor tasted like chemicals....and was so bad that I couldn't hardly drink my morning blended protein shake which has milk, eggs, oatmeal, peanut butter, banana, and a scoop of protein powder in it when I added this stuff. The chemical taste was so bad it overpowered everything in the shake. It was extremely hard to drink 8 oz of milk (I always use milk not water) with one scoop of the protein, the taste was so bad I could barely drink it. I think its the sucralose (artificial sweetener) they add in it to sweeten it up. As far as the other flavors I haven't tried them, hopefully the chocolate and vanilla are much better in flavor. I will never order this in a strawberry flavor again!

  I tried the Premium Gold 100% WHEY PROTEIN (Vanilla Ice Cream) from Muscletech before this and it was a much different consistency and flavor. The Vanilla flavor of PHASE8 tastes more like chemicals than anything, and the consistency is like trying to mix sand with water (very grainy). The previous product was much more chalky and mixed way better. I bought this for the price, which was about $10 cheaper than most other brands, so I can't complain too much if it still does the job. I'm not the type of person to waste things, so I will finish the tub, but I won't be buying PHASE8 again. That extra $10 seems worth it now. Lol. I also might try to avoid Vanilla flavoring in the future since most companies just can't seem to get it right.

The Triple Chocolate flavor does not have a  aftertaste like some other Chocolate protein competitors that I have tried which have had a chalky bitter aftertaste. MuscleTech is known for making well made products and the Phase 8 protein is no exception. This is a great protein for pre-workout to help get you fueled up before your workout and  especially for post-workouts, with the hydrolyzed whey protein isolate and the casein protein for the slow digesting at nigh before bed to help pack on some lean muscle mass and repair muscle. So far, I have packed on 3 lbs of lean muscle mass!  I would recommended this product.

  I'm really fond of MuscleTech's ""Whey Gold"" line, and the vanilla flavor there. It's some of the best vanilla whey I've tasted. I was hoping for more or less the same here, anticipating some slight deviation given the added ingredient and benefit list here.Unfortunately, I'm guessing due to whatever additive pack or filler they're using to hit the advertised supplement list, the flavor is pretty awful. It leaves a kind of off-coffee aftertaste. That said, I've tried a different brand's whey+creatine mix product, and this one does a better job of masking the aftertaste. Still thoroughly unpleasant though, whereas Whey Gold is an absolute treat to drink.

  Been using this protein for about a month, not a bad product no stomach issues at all no bloating. One little thing that bothered me is the residue that it leaves at the bottom of the shaker which is a pain to wash out after, no matter how much time I shake it, I mix one full scoop with a full bottle of water (16oz) which is double the amount indicated on the label but still have that issue.

  Been in the gym and doing protein powders for almost 20 yrs.If ya like your protein to be remotely on the thicker side after mixing let alone kind of thick, don't follow the instructions and use less water.1 scoop + 8 oz water = flavored water.I'm still experimenting on the right combo for me.  I've got it down so far to 1 scoop + 6 oz water = thicker drink.  I always do 2 scoops and oatmeal for breakfast so you could imagine what it was like after I've been using cheaper proteins which made a great shake doing 1 scoop + get this....12 oz water.Not buying this again because I need my breakfast to hang with me...not digest and me be hungry again 60 min later.Powder stays clumpy and strawberry is not a good choice of flavor.With Muscletech being ""America's #1 selling bodybuilding supplement brand"" as stated on their product, they sure did miss the mark on this!

  It is a good protein power with okay taste profile. I usually get MusclePharm blended protein and in the past I have used mainly OK whey protein.

Compared to MP and OK, MuscleTech Phase8 protein powder flavor is not very appealing.

  after 2 months of use, I continue to be amazed at how great tasting this supplement is. I drink it as instructed with water only, and half and half with vanilla almond milk. By far the best tasting protein powder I've ever used. Which can go a long way when you work out on the regular basis and don't want to get tired of the taste. However the time released protein mechanism is questionable at best. while I haven't had any symptoms of low blood sugar using this product prior to my normal run and strength training, I can say that I'm usually very hungry during and afterward. Which I've never experienced with any other product. This may be due to the low calorie formula. But even with the appropriate amount of protein I would assume that shouldn't be the case. with that in mind I still have some reservations about Recommending this product.

  This protein powder had all the ingredients I wanted to take post workout and throughout the day. It gave me the immediate effects of whey protein as well as the longer release of the casein protein. The flavor was overall just as good if not better than other chocolate flavors, and it mixed really well with water. Recommended for anyone looking for that extra protein during their day!

  First time trying this protein powder. I have had it for a few months now. I only use it when I cannot reach my protein macros with food. I usually drink it at night before bed and it actually helps me sleep better. The taste is good but there are some clumps that are not easy to dissolve just by shaking.

  I will continue to purchase this protein as it is one of the best I have ever had.  The Chocolate flavor is hands down the best out there.  As far as the Amino Acid delivery, you can tell that it is working because with the proper diet your body feels fueled throughout the work day!  I love Phase8 and how well it works/tastes, I highly recommend anyone try this out!

  I never write reviews for things, but this stuff inspired me to for all the wrong reasons.As a slim guy trying to make gains (bro) I drink a protein shake or smoothie a day to supplement my protein intake.  I prefer protein blends because my research has told me these are better overall than just whey protein alone.  The 4.6 pound strawberry flavor of this was on a mega-discount, and I‚Äôve never had a problem with Muscletech protein before, so I gave it a shot.Boy lemme tell ya.  ‚ÄúStrawberry‚Äù does not describe this flavor.  It does sound better than ‚ÄúPepto Bismol,‚Äù which is what this -actually- tastes like.And I‚Äôm not the nit-picky type when it comes to flavors‚Äînot like I‚Äôm making protein cr√©me br√ªl√©e or whatever the keto freaks are doing on Pinterest‚Äîbut nothing can mask how bad this stuff is.  Blueberries.  Bananas.  Peanut Butter.  Chocolate syrup.  Yogurt.  All of the above together.  Nothing.The strawberry flavor is abysmal.  It makes me think of being sick as a kid, and being excited about it because I didn‚Äôt have to go to school, then having that excitement stripped away because I would always have to drink some liquid pink chalk before I could watch The Price is Right.  I‚Äôm sure the other flavors aren‚Äôt that bad.  The strawberry one is.  Help control the pet population y‚Äôall; have your pet spayed or neutered.

  Gross and is so clumpy does not dissolve easily and even stirring for two mins was still clumpy. Really disappointed as other reviews stated it was not clumpy.  Do not buy.

  Update. Before they used to sell the bigger 4.6 lbs bottle. Now they say its the same value selling 2.2lbs. Definitely not the same. Its only a minor difference but it was better buying in bulk vs the smaller one. Still taste great and same ingredients. Just hate them cutting down on volume.

    Weird fake sweet flavor & aftertaste

  Tried to save a few dollars by buying this one instead of my usual fave.  Instant regret.The protein itself seems to be decent enough, and it's a nice smooth texture.  It's the taste that gets me.  Waaaaaay too much fake sweet taste.  I've had others that use sucralose that don't taste this funky.  I'm not sure if it's their flavoring itself or the sweetener, but GAG!  I'll definitely be going back to BSN products.

  Phase 8 is a great product. Hands down one of the best tasting protiens ive tried. I love taking it before bed and even adding it to my oatmeal for breakfast. It keeps my muscles fueled for up to 8 hours which is great for my active lifestyle. As always never disappointed by muscletech.

    Tastes Great, Helps Me Stay Full, Seems to Aid Recovery

  The vanilla flavor is great and blends incredible well with just a shaker bottle! Additionally, the slow release casein protein definitely helps me feel full longer compared to a previous protein powder I was using. The cost is incredibly low for a mix of this quality and quantity! I definitely feel like my workout recovery time has been improved by using this product. I was spending a lot of my time sore and struggling to get a full recovery between workouts (which was lowering my work out performance as I fought through soreness and fatigue), but after getting this protein blend with some immediate recovery benefits (from the whey isolates) as well as sustained recovery benefits (from the casein blend), my workouts have been progressing as I had hoped! Can't say enough good things about this protein performance wise and flavor wise. Be warned though, since the powder is so fine (for ideal blending ability) it is like a fine dust and if you are not very careful, you will get the fine dust all over your counters/kitchen scooping in a hurry. So just take your time and you will love this protein!
