  I bought the 5.13lb tub of chocolate natural whey about 3 months ago, and I still have a little bit left.  This was my first purchase of an all natural whey powder, and I must say the taste is much different.  Different how?  Its better!!!  When it came to cheaper products that used artificial sweeteners, I would always get ""gut rot,"" or a really really upset stomach.  Plus, I was always left with a really dry mouth and bad breath.  The Gold Standard natural whey powder, on the other hand, tastes great, mixes well, and I feel fantastic after drinking (no upset tummies here).  Totally worth the purchase, I will continue to buy this product, once I freaking run out, that is.  Its great not having to worry about paying for whey powder every month or so when I have a colossal 5.13 tub just chillin' on my fridge.  Again, I totally recommend this product.  After years of gulping down tall glasses of what now seems like soot and dust (artificially sweetened whey powders), the Gold Standard whey powder is phenomenal.  Go get you some!

This on is the best tasting, mixes well and is the best buy for the dollar.  We also like the ingredients - no artificial flavors, etc.  We don't feel like we are putting unnecessary ingredients in our bodies.

  Recently I shopped around for protein powders when my local retailer stopped selling the 5 lb. bag of EAS for such a great price. So I turned to online retailers. And since I was shopping around, I decided to compare EAS with other brands and Optimum Nutrition is what I settled on. I'm glad I did. This is the first time I have had this brand, but it is already hands-down my favorite. That's putting it up against EAS, which I really like but does have a tendency to clump, and Designer Whey Protein, which is not as flavorful, but mixes EXTREMELY well. If you're torn between this or Designer Whey Protein, you can't go wrong with either. I do not have any problems with clumping with Optimum Nutrition in just a shaker cup and the same can be said for Designer. Many weight lifters and exercise enthusiasts will tell you that this is one of the best protein powders, partly because it does taste great and mixes well, but also because it is made from whey protein isolate, which is a highly-concentrated protein. One scoop delivers 24 grams of protein. The ingredient list is VERY short (which is usually a good thing) and depending on the flavor you choose (vanilla in my case), it is all natural. I'm happy with the Amazon price, and I'm extremely happy with the product.

  I bought this thinking that I would have to be taking my weight in grams of protein(about 150g) a day to gain a pound of muscle. This however I learned isn't true and can be bad for you if you are taking too much. Regardless I still use it but usually only about 2 scoops a day(about 50g). I also eat other stuff that has protein like beans and tofu( I am a vegan), I chose to pick whey over soy because of the whole estrogen thing, so I made a exception to my vegan diet because I didn't want to be eating a lot of soy. I purchased this using the free shipping that was suppose to take 5-8 days, funny thing too it was estimated to arrive between march 5-8 2011. It arrived on the 2nd, so I think I lucked out. The best way to eat this stuff I think is to not do what everyone does and mix it with water and drink it yuck. Mix one scoop with a cup of rolled oats and then mix water with it, a lot better than drinking it. Also make it with banana shakes or any shakes, banana shake is easier though, only 4 ingredients, 1 banana, some ice(you have to eye ball it), some milk(almond milk for vegans), and vanilla extract. Add the scoop of protein powder slowly into the shake while blending, this thickens it up and adds the PROTEIN!

  I am a 20something female and needed an easy way to add more protein to my diet since starting a new workout regimen. The gym I go to has ""fitchecks"" at each visit which calculates lean muscle level. Before the protein powder, I was only taking in a third of the recommended protein and it really showed in my results (my muscle level kept fluctuating but never gaining). A couple years ago I tried the optimum nutrition whey (which I overall liked but bought on a whim and didn't look at the ingredients) as well as the CVS brand powder which was far too sweet and caused terrible bloating. For this most recent fitness kick, I decided to shell out the money for this natural version which does not have any artificial sweeteners. I am no expert on fitness and nutrition but if you're going to be taking this daily, you might as well buy a quality product with the fewest ingredients possible. The stevia in this adds just the right amount of sweetness, it tastes great, mixes well (even with just a spoon), doesn't cause bloating, and the extra protein has definitely improved my numbers and muscle gain. The only downside I can see is the cost, but I think it's worth the few extra bucks for the natural version.

  Everything that ON makes is good. This whey tastes not bad and has a noticeable effect in that I feel I get more lean and muscular on this as opposed to other brands that I have used. I prefer whey-only rather than casein or a blend because whey-only eliminates the bloat that the others give you. If you're going to drink 2 or 3 shakes throughout the day, the time-release attributes of casein and blends becomes academic.Oh, and the price is right.

  My aunt, cousin and I have started working out together and wanted to add protein shakes to our post-workout routine.  Our two major concerns were price and that chalk-in-the-mouth feeling that can accompany some shakes. This protein powder has taken both of those concerns off the table. We ordered a 5-lb jug of vanilla which has 71 servings. My aunt likes to mix it with milk, my cousin likes to mix it with frozen fruit and I like to mix it with water. All three variations are delicious. Even with just water, the flavor is smooth and not too strong. We will be ordering more of this.... 71 servings from now.

  I am really happy with this natural whey protein. I have been watching what I've been putting in my body, especially artificial sweeteners and I'm happy that this is available. As I am lactose intolerant, the lactase they add into this powder is really effective - I haven't had any digestive issues since using this as a supplement. It's filling and mixes really well in a blender or shaker cup. The flavor (vanilla) isn't to die for, but it's subtle and great enough to take before or after a workout, or to mix with frozen berries and greek yogurt.I believe I'll be with this whey protein for quite a while.

  The natural vanilla has a chalky and fake sweetener after-taste.  I've tried that french vanilla (not natural) and that one is a little better, but still never tastes good with water.  This one also gets a sort of foamy when you mix it in a blender- BUT, you sort of have to mix it in a blender because it doesn't blend well otherwise.

  Best tasting Whey out there. Period. I love the Vanilla and have for years. I put two cups of milk, a banana, frozen berries, and a big handful of spinach and put it in a blender and it makes a awesome post workout or meal replacement. But you can just put it in a glass of milk and blend it with a spoon. Doesnt get too clumpy at all. Doesnt get all that foamy like some whey does after the Blender. I honestly, and no lie, will not use another form of Whey protein as long as they keep making this.

    Best Protein I've Ever Had In Years
  
","









  
  
    
  I've been using this protein powder for about 3-4 years now. I've only used two other protein powders. Body Fortresses chocolate and peanut butter. (Tastes like Resses Cup.) They sell them for cheap at my local Walmart. $18 for a 2lb. As opposed to this one which has a 2lb for $31 right now.  The other one was an ON protein powder as well. I used to buy the double rich chocolate flavor for that one. And it would come in the red and black case. They also had some flavors that this one doesn't have. That I've never got to try. Like the coffee and mocha cappuccino.The reason why I stopped using those other protein was because I was starting to get tired of the taste. And I started to dread taking protein shakes because of it. I used the black and red ON for about 3 years. And the Body Fortress for maybe a year and a half around the same time. The taste was just way too over powering. Especially the B.F. Which doesn't surprise me since it's so cheap. B.F has other flavors too, and 30g of protein per serving instead of ON's 24g. But their scoop is considerably bigger. And I'm honestly fine with paying almost double the price for this products quality.This one was definitely my favorite of the 3. And I plan to continue drinking it for the years to come. I believe I've only ever gotten the vanilla flavor for this one. But am so satisfied with the taste. That I don't really feel the need to switch. I'll only ever mix it with water as a last result. Like when I'm out of whole milk, or almond milk. I like how it tastes with whole milk the most. Plus, whole milk adds more protein. In my opinion, I think it tastes the worst with water. Whenever I drink it, I'll just mix it in one of my coffee mugs. And it dissolves real easily. Which is another thing I like about this powder. The taste isn't strong, but you can still taste the vanilla quite well. But sometimes, I put just a little bit of my vanilla coffee creamer to give it a boost of taste. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this protein. And never got sick of the taste so far. When I was working 11-13 hour shifts at my last job. Which was at a warehouse. I would drink 2 a day, 5 times a week. Along with some coffee during break or on my lunch. Literally, whenever I didn't the coffee and protein. I'd feel so tired and sluggish at work. As if I only had an hours sleep. I highly recommend this product and brand. I use to, and still have my other supplements. All of which, are from this Brand, ON. My creatine, BCAA, HMB, and ZMAs. I use to take all that when I worked out like every day a few years ago.j But I don't anymore. Now I'll just stick to trying to get most of my protein from real food. Like eggs, tuna, peanut butter, chicken, tilapia, ham, almonds, and cottage cheese. I've always heard it's better to get most of your protein from actual food. Even so, I'm still taking 1-2 of these protein shakes before and after I workout. :) And I suppose this is a good alternative if you don't have immediate access to a protein based food. Or you're a vegan.

  This is my first protein supplement. The 5lb bottle was shipped nearly full and comes with a scoop to help you portion your servings. It has a somewhat sweet taste which I find goes well with orange juice (tastes like creamsicle), chocolate milk, strawberry milk, apple cider, and various fruit-based drinks. It also adds a lot of substance to fruit shakes as well. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to mix so you get little lumps when you drink it, but if you just keep stirring for a few minutes it dissolves well.

Unlike my husband's protein powder that you have to go crazy on with a shaker bottle. I put a scoop in a glass, and poured water over it. I hardly had to stir! There were no lumps!This does not upset my stomach like most protein powders do, and has no artificial sweeteners.

  For me, the bottom line with whey protein is that it needs to taste good, is easy on my digestion, and has the ""right stuff"" without convoluting the product description with a ton of broscience BS like ""You'll gain 100lbs of PURE muscle in the first HOUR after taking this!"" that every consumer should avoid at all costs. So...Does it taste good?Absolutely. Mix with peanut butter or banana to add an extra flavor boost, or it's great on its own. I generally mix with vanilla flavored almond milk, so it adds richness as well. To each their own.Is it easy on digestion?When I first started taking it, I had some very frequent trips to my magazine stand (bathroom), but this went away within 1 week of consistent use.Does it have the ""right stuff"" without the BS claims?I believe so. I'm not going to pretend like I have a bunch of knowledge about nutrition - I just want something that will supplement my goals to live a healthy and fit lifestyle. 24g of protein per serving, no artificial sweeteners (they usually upset my stomach), no weird chemicals that I can't pronounce, and it doesn't pretend like this is God's supplement gift that will grant special powers and strength to folks who want to stay in shape. It's a product to SUPPLEMENT a healthy LIFESTYLE.I use this about twice a day - once in the morning after I workout and once in the evening (whether I get a second workout in or not). If you're very sensitive to dairy, I would seek out a whey protein isolate product. It's more costly, but I would definitely opt for it myself if cost weren't an issue. This is a reasonably priced alternative that I will be using for the foreseeable future. If you're on the fence about this stuff, just get it. You will not be disappointed.

  Reasonably priced (as compared with the competition -- I feel that all whey protein products are a bit pricier than they should be), no artificial sweeteners, very decent flavor. Works quite well as a base for mixing with fruit or electrolyte powder.Not sure what's up with all of the people complaining about taste. I find it totally inoffensive.. But who cares? Chug it down and move on! Whey shakes are not meant to be savored.I don't find that it mixes quite as easily as they claim. Stirring doesn't do the trick; it needs to be shaken a bit, either in a blender bottle or just a sealed water bottle. Otherwise it forms little chewy chunks. But that's a minor quibble.Downgraded to four stars as I've tried a few other wheys since writing this review and some others offer superior mixability.

But this vanilla whey...  wonderful!  Blend it in a glass of slim milk and some strawberries and I have a 35+g protein shake in the morning.  I can add it to plain water to have some good vanilla flavoring while boosting protein intake at the same time.  I haven't tried the chocolate flavor but since there is no added sweetener, I don't know how it would taste.  Thus I went vanilla and have never looked back.

  Not sure when Optimum Nutrition released the all-natural version of their whey powder, but am really glad they did. For the past few years, I have been using their 

  
Vanilla Ice Cream-flavored whey protein









  
  
    
  , which tastes great. The fact it contains artificial sweeteners (and I was using it almost daily) was a nagging worry though.The all-natural version tastes *almost* as good as the vanilla-flavored stuff. If you blend it with some frozen fruit and milk, it's pretty difficult to taste the difference. I'd say the marginal difference is taste is easily overcome by the health advantage of not consuming artificial sweeteners on a daily basis.

I like to get vanilla whey powder because I often use it for cooking, but my last batch was ""rich vanilla"" and I loved the flavor a lot more. I mix this flavor with chocolate almond milk or sugar free creamer and that does the trick wihtout adding too many calories.

  I have used lots of different protein products (among other things) and this one seems to work well.  I previously used Muscle Milk Protein Plus, but after Costco stopped carrying it I couldn't find it any more.  Since my wife uses it too I had to get something with ok taste, low calories and high quality protein and this one does the trick.  I am not a big fan of the sweetener (natural, stevia I believe) so I ended up blending in a scoop of the Muscle Milk pure whey for flavor.  My wife doesn't mind the stevia so she is good with this product by itself.

  Before finding out about this brand, I had tried a few other protein powders from stores like GNC. They tasted absolutely awful and I started to dread the post-workout shake. I decided to try Optimum through a recommendation I read online and have never looked back! The most significant difference to me is how delicious it tastes. Unlike those other brands, this one actually tastes really good. I've tried vanilla and chocolate so far and both have far exceeded my expectations. In addition to this, the price is phenomenal for this caliber of quality. You really can't go wrong with it.

  I just opened this tub of whey protein.  Besides not being able to find the scooper, everything else was as expected...quick shipping, great value, superior taste.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to gain muscle weight, lose fat, build muscle, or just supplement your regular diet.  It works for everyone...women, seniors, pregnant women, kids, dieters, any level of body builder, athletes, sedentary people...  Use prior to working out, after working out, first thing in the morning, midnight snack, or whenever you want some good nutrition.  This makes a great snack with water, milk, soy/almond milk, orange juice, or any other liquid.  It dissolves easily with just a spoon to mix it up.  Remember, unless you have kidney problems, you can consume as much protein as you like.  You can lose weight by replacing a fast food lunch with just a couple of scoops of this mixed with skim milk.Just mix and enjoy!

  Very disappointed, won't be buying again.has a terrible chemical/'chalky' flavor.IMO, tastes nothing like vanilla.I purchased this due to the fact that it didn't have any ""artificial"" flavoring/ingredients. Prior to this, the only protein powders I've tried are the ON natural chocolate (which tasted bland but had an acceptable chocalately taste), and the Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein, Vanilla flavor (which tastes great to me, but has splenda and a bunch of artificial flavoring/ingredients).I was looking for something more ""natural,"" without a bunch of sugar and artificial ingredients, yet with a decent, acceptable taste, so I decided to try the ON natural vanilla. I'm not the type of person to expect amazing taste from my protein shake; I can deal with a fair amount of blandness, lack of flavor, or even tolerate a bit ""gross""-ness. However, the taste of this stuff is almost unbearable. I now understand what people mean by having a 'chalky' taste. Adding sugar/honey to try to sweeten the taste didn't help, and is counter to the goal of consuming a light-weight, low-carb protein shake. It doesn't taste like vanilla at all in my opinion; it tastes far more artificial and 'chemical' than I would have expected. I will have to deal with the horrible taste until I finish the tub, and then I'll look for something else.

  I have been buying this for use in home-made meal replacement shakes as part of a low-carb, low-calorie diet and am very happy.  It's a high quality, natural protein powder and tastes great too.There are two different kinds of shakes I have been making.  When I'm in a hurry I mix 1.5 scoops with a 1/2 teaspoon of dark chocolate powder and 14 oz. of almond milk, shake it up in one of those gravy mixers, and then bring with me in a plastic solo cup.  These shakes come good and are filling enough to keep me going until lunch.  They aren't as creamy as the blender and tend to have a few chunks of powder in them, but it fits my needs when I need to hurry out the door.When I have more time, I have been using the blender with 1.5 scoops of protein powder, a few frozen strawberries, kale, and almond milk.  This powder really works well in the blender - the shakes are very smooth and creamy.  With the frozen strawberries, you don't even need ice.  For lunch I've been mixing 1.5 scoops with 2 Tbs. of natural peanut butter, 1/2 tsp of dark chocolate powder, and almond milk.  I do add a few ice cubes to this to make it a little thicker.I'm very happy with this protein powder and how it has helped with my weight loss.  It keeps me full with minimal snacking throughout the day.  I will continue buying this powder as long as I continue on my diet.

I tend to mix the powder with water, immediately after a workout, which may contribute to the bland taste.  As a variable, I mixed the powder with milk and it did taste much better!

  NOTE: The image (as of when this review was written) of the nutrition label is the wrong label for this product. The label on the tub I have at home doesn't list salt or sucrose as ingredients. This review is only for the Naturally Flavored Vanilla Whey product.When I opened this tub, I was initially put off by the smell because it was so different from any other whey protein powders I had tried. I bought a smaller tub (I think it was 2 lbs) to try before committing to the 5 lb tub. Before this, I was using Royal Sport Whey, Vanilla Ice Cream flavored. And prior to that, I was using Double Rich Chocolate from ON.I somehow got used to the overly sweet Royal Sport product, so when I switched to ON's all-natural whey, I was a bit put off by the taste of my smoothies and I was SUPER hesitant about drinking the powder mixed with water after my workouts. But I actually got used to the flavor really quickly—it's not overly sweet like other whey products I've tried, and it doesn't smell as...I don't know. Chemical-ley? Granted, it still doesn't smell great, but I do like the flavor profile a lot better than other whey proteins.The vanilla flavor isn't overpowering and neither is the sweetener (sugar). It's about 30 cals more per scoop than my old whey, but it's worth the compromise, in my opinion. I went back to try the Royal Sport whey and found I couldn't stomach the smell or taste any longer (and now I have to return that one)—it made my smoothies much too sweet, and as an after-workout mixed with water, I could barely choke it down.

  I have consumed many protein powders during my life and not a single one has been as bad as this one. I read other reviews and generally do not care if a few say it doesn't taste great because I will mix it and it'll be fine.This is the single worst tasting protein powder I have ever had. I threw up a few minutes after I drank a shake with 1 scoop in it because of how gross it felt. The ""natural"" flavor is something I can  only describe as like a licorice after taste but much more chemical. It has been 24 hours since I tried it and I have eaten multiple meals, and I still can't get the awful aftertaste seared out of my tastebud memory. Everything I eat or drink somehow now reminds me of my experience with this powder. I hope it stops soon.Worst of all, covid-19 has made this product difficult to return. I discarded the box because it was not safe to bring into my home, and amazon wants me to either take this to a UPS store (exposing myself to lines and potentially the virus) or pay to have it picked up in its original box, which I don't even have. I am exceedingly frustrated by both this product and the return process.

  It's whey protein that doesn't taste bad.  I've been using ON natural for a few years and have found it to be the best bang for the buck.  I will say that I prefer the Any Whey product that they have (great for cooking), but it's ~$25 more.  So, all in all, ON natural whey is a great way to get in some additional daily protein to meet your training/body requirements.

  I've tried many protein powders in the past. This particular naturally flavored ON whey is definitely at the top of my list. I've tried the regular Gold Standard (red/black container), I couldn't stand the after-taste after some time. I'm not a fan of different added flavor like chocolate or strawberry. In terms of value for money, it's a good value, but it's definitely expensive over time especially after I put it on subscribe & save.

    The Standard for What a Whey Protein Supplement Should Be
  
","









  
  
    
  I love this protein. I love the Optimum Nutrition natural line. I look for just a couple of things when it comes to a protein supplement. I could care less about taste because I'm not looking for a desert, I want nutrition. I run 50 miles a week and lift 4x, so protein supplementation is important especially with my time constraints. Even though taste isn't what I'm looking for in a protein supplement, this is a very respectably tasting protein supplement. I'm almost through my bottle and I have the shake 2x per day, sometimes in place of meals and I never feel like it's lacking anything at all. I've never really gotten sick of it. It's got no added sugar, it's all natural, and has no chemical sugars. Some protein supplements/bars are chalked full of crap (chemical sugars, fake sugars, extra sugars, palm oil, etc.) but Optimum Nutrition has really set the standard with this line. This is probably the only whey protein I will take. My advice is to stick with ON's natural line and avoid the other stuff.Another brand I've tried in the past and enjoyed is Designer Whey Natural (just the plain stuff, with no flavor).

  I probably would have given this protein powder 3 stars no matter what just for using all natural products. I can't stand artificial sweeteners - they make me sick to my stomach.  But I'm going to give it a full 5 stars because it works. I've been growing at a slow, steady pace in the recent past, though I notice I always seem to have some residual soreness. Drinking two shakes a day of this whey protein has virtually eliminated that. I feel I can go full blast at whatever activity I'm doing without worrying how it'll affect me for the following few days. Whatever it is about this whey protein, it's getting into my body in a meaningful way.You probably want to know about the taste. It's kind of bland, like you might expect from a plain vanilla whey protein powder. Nothing gross or offensive to the senses. Then again all I do is mix it with water and ice then chug. If you mix it in a shake with a little milk, or maybe an extra spoonful of sugar, or a scoop of ice cream, it might be really good. Or you might end up with additional volume of bland. Truth is, I kind of like it that way. If you want something different, try the chocolate or strawberry. But do try it.

  Sorry for the awful title.Got into fitness earlier in the year.  Both my wife (mid-20s) and I (in my late 20s) were unhappy with our bodies.  Too little exercise, too much good (bad) food.  Our goal was (and is) to increase lean muscle to help burn more fat.  My additional goal is to get some sweet guns (almost there, pew pew).I think we're onto our 6th or 7th 5lb tub now.  We use ON 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural (Vanilla) now but originally used the 100% Whey Gold Standard (Vanilla Ice Cream and sometimes Double Chocolate).We stopped using the Vanilla Ice Cream (and others from the non-Natural range) mainly due to the sweeteners and flavourings used.  Yes, they do taste a little bit better but not by enough to assuage our misgivings about the ingredients.If you're even a little bit paranoid about artificial sweeteners and flavourings, Optimum Nutrition's Natural range is great.  We've even started using pure Stevia (the same natural sweetener used in this powder) for our tea and coffee.We've yet to try the Chocolate or Strawberry flavours but find the Vanilla to be pleasant tasting (although not fantastic) with milk or juice, and tolerable when mixed with water.Regarding mixing, I gently tap in small amounts and stir briskly with chopstick, which usually mixes quite well and leaves few lumps.  My wife is impatient and dumps it all in, making it impossible to mix smoothly and resulting in a super-lumpy drink.  Haven't tried a shaker yet but when blended into smoothies it's completely lump free.Our main reason for sticking with Vanilla is its versatility; we use this whey protein in OJ, smoothies, with our oatmeal, occasionally even sprinkled on cereal (yes, a bit weird that one).A significant factor in sticking with this particular product is price.  We're only paying around $33 per 5 pound tub using Subscribe & Save.  Free shipping.That's pretty astonishing when you consider that ON's whey provides more protein per serving than other, more expensive, brands.Results?  Well, I gained some muscle and definition, and I definitely lost some fat.  I don't think I could eat enough meat or drink enough milk to get the amount of protein required to build and, crucially, maintain muscle.  For me, this is an essential supplement.

  I've been using this in my morning protein shakes for a week now. It's not as sweet as my last protein powder(muscle milk) but then again there are no artificial sweeteners in this one! I use it in a shake made of 1 1/2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk, cocoa powder, flaxseed oil and peppermint oil, every morning. The sweetness is very light. It does recommend for a sweeter taste, to put it in 4 to 6 oz of liquid. So yes the more liquid you use, the less sweet it's going to be. It has a smooth texture and mixes well(I've mixed it with a Magic Bullet and an immersion blender). I haven't had any issues with left over clumps or a chalky taste after it is mixed. Overall, I would buy it again. $53.00 might sound like a lot to some but the fact that you get 72 scoops out of it, is a great deal. I use it once a day so I will only have to buy it about every 2 1/2 months.

  I confess when I first tried this protein powder it's taste was so different from all the other Optimum Nutrition flavors that I was disappointed and a bit upset. After using it several times the flavor and lack of really sweet taste has grown on me. When it comes to sweets I not only have a sweet tooth but have a whole mouth full of sweet teeth. In other words I really love sweets! This protein powder is a nice break from the usual overly sweet taste of most protein powders.  I will buy it again as long as it is available. Good stuff!

I know protein isn't meant to taste like a 5 star restaurant meal but with 3g of sugar per serving I was expecting a little more. Thought about returning it but I'll stick it out. If you don't mind taste then I would recommend this product. Otherwise, stick to chocolate flavor.

  I use this in fruit smoothies.  It tastes great -- not chalky or funky in any way.  I like that it is all natural and is not loaded up with sugar.  But as I write this, I double checked the label to see how much sugar it had...3 g per scoop as I recall.  But it tastes pretty sweet it seems to me...like beyond 3 g of sugar...so I read on.  Listed in the ingredients, but mentioned nowhere else other than to say ""free of artificial flavors and sweeteners,"" is, ""Rebaudioside A.""  Well, I recognized that, sort of...as very similar to the label on my Stevia sweetener which is ""Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni.""  So....it's a version of Stevia -- a sweetener derived from the leaves of the Stevia plant.  I got no problem with that...it's terrific I think.  Stevia is even associated with other health benefits as I recall (see Wikipedia).  Why not mention it?  Marketing issue?  Is there a PR issue with Stevia?  Idk.  Just thought I'd add it here since others write more about the protein issues.  Again, I think it's a great product.

  I love this protein but ON changed the size from 5 lbs to 4.8. The choice between this and the normal gold standard whey used to be a no brainer. It was one serving less for the same price with no artificial sweeteners/flavors. Using a blender or even a shaker it makes a great shake. If you're coming from artificially sweetened protein, you will be shocked at its sweetness - or lack thereof. It's light on flavor and sweetness so you can basically put anything you want in it. I usually throw a banana and some peanut butter into the chocolate flavor post workout and it goes right down. The size, though... I don't appreciate them making it smaller and charging the same (as if anyone does). Really a low move by ON. I knocked it one star for that reason. If you're undeterred by getting five less servings per container, then by all means buy it. Great protein.As an aside, I notice some reviewers mentioning that not all the ingredients are ""natural"" anymore. I haven't bought this new size and formula so I cannot attest to whether or not it's still all natural. Prior to reformulation, it was.

  Just received the Vanilla, 5 lb. Whey Protein. Very timely shipping (actually a day early), however, there was no ""scoop"" inside of the jug? I've bought protein over the years and this is the first time it hasn't been included. For counting purposes, it makes it hard to know exactly how much I am consuming when I don't know the dimensionality of the scoop. Hopefully this was just missed and not a sketchy cut cutting tactic!If someone can comment on if it is a standard scoop (as in most protein powders), that would be very helpful. Taste and effectiveness review will come after I use it for a while.

    Best Whey Out There

  I was already a fan of Optimum Nutrition whey but decided to try this one in order to avoid artificial ingredients. Since I'm trying to gain weight anyway, the slight increase in carb count for this product really doesn't matter to me. It tastes better than artificially flavored whey and mixes well as all ON products do. Buy it!

  If you're totally out of shape and trying to make a change for the better, then add this to your diet. Almost instantly I noticed much quicker recovery times and much more energy. It really helps to keep me motivated. Waking up the next morning feeling good after a quick stretch is much preferred to having to roll off the bed sideways because I worked my abs to hard and my muscles are still recovering. I've noticed a lot more endurance even with my golf practice sessions. Before I used to get completely pooped after hitting a 120 balls and just slump into the car and go home. After adding the whey shakes to my daily routine, I'm hitting at least 200-300 balls and have enough energy to go home and make dinner and enjoy the evening. One of the other huge benefits to this particular product is that it doesn't use any artificial sweeteners. I really do not want any nutrasweet/equal/splenda in my diet. Oh and one other thing, I'm always in a rush in the mornings so I go the simple route and mix the powder with 8 ounces of grapefruit or orange juice in a blender bottle. The blender bottles are awesome and leave no clumps and the shakes taste great. It's really that simple. You can't go wrong with this product.

  In the continued attempt to transition to a more healthy lifestyle, this protein has been a great help. Since joining a gym at the beginning of the year I have tried various protein powders and found that the Optimum Nutrition line has been best for me. I tried this particular product because of the ""Natural"" label on it. I must say as far as vanilla protein powders go this has been the best tasting one yet. Since I have only used this product for about a month I am not willing to give it a 5-star review.

  If you're simply looking for a natural protein, this is the one to get. There are better protein powders out there that have added benefits (more vitamins, more protein, amino acids...) but you will not find a better natural protein for the money. I've been using this for 7-months (I was using the non-natural Gold Standard whey for 3+ years) and I've noticed I feel generally better, haven't gotten a cold since I've been using it (not sure if it's because of this or not, but it's a good bit of information) and it doesn't stain my teeth (my dentist was wondering why I would have slight stains. I don't drink coffee or soda btw).I consume this as soon as I wake up with a banana (been doing this for 1 year) and I've trimmed up quite a bit. It's so important to have some breakfast as soon as you wake up to jump start your metabolism for the day and this, plus my banana, does the trick for a quick 5min breakfast.

  Cheapest way to get protein by my initial calculations.  Does not taste great by any stretch of the imagination.  I found if you mix it with too much water relative to the mix it tastes worse.  Currently I mix 8 oz of water with one scoop with about 1/4 table spoon of chocolate powder.  (Update: I mixed it today with 12 ounces of nonfat milk with 2 scoops and 1/2 tbsp of chocolate powder.  Tastes ok.)  If you cannot stand the taste then go with protein bars.  They taste more like candy bars but are double the cost.  (They also have more calories).  As far as building muscle I do not lift weights except an occasional dumbbell and I am over 60.  Also I am in the process of losing weight.  It may be my imagination but I think the addition of protein to my diet is helping me with my weight loss by increasing the amount of fat lost relative to muscle lost.  I think I was losing more muscle before.  (The belly fat just won't go away completely!)  Final thought that may be useful.  I track my calories and I find that when I am using protein supplements, I find it easier to keep my calories below 2000.  It satisfies hunger better.

  This, in my opinion, is the best Whey protein supplement I have found on the market.  I've tried several products from various companies, but this product from Optimum Nutrition tops them all.  This vanilla flavor tastes very natural (no artificial aftertaste).  I usually use it after a workout with one percent milk and blend it with a hand-held stick mixer in a tall plastic glass.  You can use water if you want to reduce your calorie intake. However, it taste better with low-fat milk. It comes with a scoop already inside the container and the protein content per scoop is high per grams.  I usually use two scoops to achieve the protein level I want for post-workout.  I've noticed improvements in muscle mass utilizing this Gold Standard Natural Whey Protein supplement drink.

  This protein is one of the best I have used. It easily mixes with water especially when you're just using a shaker. Other products I have used in the past would be left in clumps no matter how hard I shook. The protein is very fine where other proteins I have used in the past would taste very grainy. This product is now apart of my subscribe and save program where I get 1 container every two months and it is enough for two people who regularly use it. I love to use it in shakes, mixed with water, in yogurt, and I also mix with melted dark chocolate and pistachios to make bark for a small energizing snack! The cost of this protein is also less expensive than those other proteins I have used in the past.

  I actually consider protein powders to be a ""food"" rather than a ""supplement"". If you don't remember anything else at all, please remember this Despite what the advertisements promise, protein supplements do not have any magical muscle-building properties!  All these powders do is provide your muscles with protein to rebuild and they are in no way superior to a well balanced meal!  I personally have never seen any research which has shown that any of these powders rebuild muscles any better than natural sources like chicken, fish, or beans/rice.  These products do serve a convenient meal replacement when you don't have time to eat a full meal.  From my experience it is very important to consume small doses of protein every 2-3 hours throughout the day for maximum muscle building and since very few people can eat a small, well balanced meal every 2-3 hours protein powders can be very useful.Costco, Walmart, and all the big box stores carry very economical protein powder, about $26 for 6lbs.  Problem is that they are all loaded with artificial flavors and sweeteners.  They often have strong artificial smells and odd aftertastes. This is my personal favorite is from Optimum Nutrition and I have been using it for about 7 years now.  Nothing artificial period, I like that!.  it is definitely not the cheapest protein but I think its worth it to have all natural ingredients.  Optimum nutrition makes several other protein powders that have artificial stuff in them, make sure ""100% natural"" is in the name and you are safe.  Look at the list of ingredients and compare it to that shown on the left, make sure there is nothing artifical sounding.

I will continue to use ON and have no plan or desire to stop, but I hate when prices have to go up or sizes change, though I realize it has to happen.  I wish somebody could set an example for about 6 months and lower a price as a promotional or something, I bet the product would fly off the shelves and show a good image to the company. Nevertheless that is wishful thinking.

  So i have been reading a lot of reviews on this product and finally bought it 3 weeks ago.First let me say that the 1 star reviewers are mostly marketers for other companies. This protein powder is potent, includes no fillers or artificial sweeteners and simply does the job.If your main concern is the flavor and do not mind artificial sweeteners than this is definitely not for you. Right off the bat i noticed that scoop size is much smaller than all others i had tried. This must be do to the fact that there are no fillers.flavor 9/10 - I drink protein for PROTEIN. As long as it is not terrible and undrinkable im fine with it. This product does not taste like BSN, MusclePharm or others out there. It is drinkable does not leave an after taste and if mixed with milk very easy on the taste buds. This is not a desert this is a supplement product.Mixability 9/10 - A little bit tougher than others but not by much. Shake 10-15 seconds more than regular and this should be no problem at all. Only protein that i was actually able to mix with a spoon.Results 10/10 - I have noticed good results while on this product. Very hard to determine if better than others or not because there are too many other factors involved as well I.E. workouts, sleep, creatine, diet and much more. So all those who claim this works better or worse than others DO NOT believe them. But the main fact is that it delivered great results with no unnecessary chemicals.Conclusion - I will most definitely buy this product again. I am very happy with the results and i feel alot better with myself knowing that it contains less artificial flavors and fillers. If you are worried about flavor and are looking to have a desert after your workout steer clear. But if your an athlete that wants results, less chemicals, less fillers and keep results in line with goals, than this is just for you.

  I just switched to this protein mainly because it does not have any ""Artificial Sweeteners"" in it. Most people don't realize that Artificial Sweeteners are toxic to the liver. When the liver gets toxic is causes the body to store ""Fat"". Storing fat is the opposite goal for myself and most people. This protein uses Stevia which is also known as Rebaudioside A and is 100% natural. It is just like adding honey to your body. Finally Im starting to build lean muscle. I blend it with water, spinach, 1/2 a banana and other fruit but not tto much fruit.

  I have been using the ON Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey for the last few months, and I'm really impressed with it.  This is the best protein supplement I have used.  I personally like the vanilla a little better, but the chocolate is great too.  Both flavors are lightly sweetened with stevia, and have only 3g of sugar, while delivering 24g of protein per serving.  I usually mix it in skim milk with a spoon (takes about a minute of vigorous stirring), but for best results, use a blender or a shaker bottle.

  The overall quality/healthiness of this product should be evident from the product description - nothing to review there.From a taste standpoint, it is not bad, but doesn't have much flavor.  With most vanilla protein, I find that it is actually extremely enjoyable to drink.  I don't have that with this protein, but given that it just takes a few seconds to drink it, a lack of taste is not really an issue.It also mixes pretty well, no chunks, although it foams up quite a bit when shaking using a blender ball.

  I have tried countless varieties of protein powder.  I think the best tasting Whey protein is Jay Robb's Whey Protein Isolate, but it is exceedingly expensive.  I really like this protein because it has no artificial sweeteners, not too many calories, and packs 24 grams of protein per scoop.  It blends perfectly in my protein shakes.  Sometimes I drink it blended with just orange juice and it tastes fine.  The taste is mild vanilla.  I find it is best to use this product in the blender, not with a spoon.  Overall, a great protein powder without the added garbage for a great price.

  Natural or 'clean' protein powders are hard to find.  The ON natural is tasty, mixes easily and is reasonably priced.  It's pretty much straight up whey protein...We add vanilla to our plain, instant oatmeal in the mornings (instead of buying the sugar laced flavored crap) in addition to flax, wheat germ and fruit.  Good way to start the day.  Just be sure you mix the oatmeal and protein together before you pour on the boiling water or you will have clumps.  The chocolate is also excellent, and usually what I use for smoothies with soy milk, a frozen banana and a tsp or so of peanut butter.

  My husband normally gets his whey protein at the store, but never  this kind. He never finishes a big tub of it and it tastes god awful! I give this Whey 4 stars because it is SO much better than the kind that my husband was buying. It might seem a bit expensive, but It really does not taste bad and it isn't god awfully thick. The kinds he was buy tasted like chalk no matter how much liquid you added and even when you made it into a smoothie. In the 6-8 oz that you mix this into, it comes out clump free and tastes much better than the cheaper stuff. I guess, buy a smaller container of it if you are worried about the flavor and try it out. I also bought cookies and cream since I read great reviews on that one. Really, I did a lot of research when I was picking one to buy and this is the one I ended up picking.

  This is my go to protein powder, mostly because it is naturally sweetened, but also because for the most part I trust ON as a company. I've been using their products for years, but recently made the switch to the naturally flavored once I realized how much junk, filler, and artificial sweeteners are used in most protein powders. With how much whey I use, the last thing I want is huge amounts of acesulfame K and sucralose to go along with it. My only complaint would be that there are only two flavors, vanilla and chocolate. Its not a huge deal, but if they came out with a small handful of more flavors I would not even hesitate suggesting this to everyone (not everyone likes vanilla or chocolate).

It tastes like paint. The Double Rich Chocolate flavor is tasty, as is the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor, but this stuff has only one valid use, and that's for an ab workout. Why? Because if you can manage to choke it down (even when mixed with nice, rich whole milk), you'll get an ab workout from throwing it back up again. YECH!Also, even though they have legally complied with labelling requirements, they've ushered in a somewhat sneaky price increase. The tub this stuff comes in is exactly the same size as they've always been using, but now it contain only 4.8 lbs of product instead of the previous 5 lbs. Although this may be totally legal, it's slimy business practice. If you want to initiate a price increase then at least have the courage to do so in an above-board manner. Don't treat your customers as idiots and just put less in the same sized tub. I've been a customer of Optimum Nutrition for DECADES, but will be looking for another whey protein provider as a result of this rather cheesy marketing stunt.

More importantly, the product does not mix as well as the original Gold Standard whey. I like the idea of a natural product, but I will be switching back to the original Gold Standard Whey next time around.

  Great taste.  No artificial sweeteners, and high in protein.  Would recommend to anyone looking to keep protein intake high, especially for those working out every day.We mix a scoop of this protein with our smoothies every morning.  Best smoothie:  Frozen strawberries, frozen cherries, milk, a tablespoon of Skippy Natural peanut butter, and a scoop of God Standard Natural Whey.  Blend it up, and good to go.  Great healthy breakfast every morning.

  This protein is great. It mixes well and has a good taste. Though to be honest, when I first tried it, it had an odd bitterness to it. My taste buds were used to the typical, overly-sweetened protein with artificial flavors in it. So this protein seemed sub-standard in taste at first. But after literally 2 servings I not only got used to the taste but really appreciated it. I was in a fitness contest and was restricting my intake of sweets down to...none. So drinking a glass of this protein became a real treat. Honestly I prefer this type of protein over the ones sweetened with Acesulfame Potassium, Sucralose or Aspartame. It may not taste as heavenly but I'd rather have less chemicals going into my body. Fun dessert tip: Smash a banana with a fork until it's like pudding, then stir in this protein, a bit of peanut butter & you have a sweet, post-workout protein dessert. Now that my contest is done I can also crumble some graham cracker in there like a pie crust.

  Just finished my container ON whey, and here are my problems;- Taste: doesn't taste anything like vanilla nor does it even contain vanilla. One would think to get something for the premium price. Good news is that its not overly sweet because it doesn't have much flavor at all.- Effects: Just finished going through a month long supplement cleanse (b/c a lack of a protein fund that is) prior of use with this product.  As always, I counted every carb and calorie I took in as well recorded my performance and gains at the gym in my trusty notebook, even when I wasn't using protein powder.  After it all I didn't notice any difference off of protein verses when I was on this (I usually do).  However I did supplement my diet when I wasn't on anything with a cup of greek yogurt, so perhaps that was enough.- Quality: It mixes easy enough, but the packaging is terrible.  Over the past three years I bought various kinds of ON protein product from various suppliers and they ALWAYS come open if in a tub or leaked a little when I bought the bag. If they don't even care enough to make sure they seal their product right, how can I trust they are doing the required quality control tests to make sure they are actually giving you what they are selling you.Over all I would probably never buy this again and continue to look for a natural PP supplement that works.

Since this is the only protein powder I've ever used, I can't say how it compares to some other products, but I will say that it's worked well for me and it's more cost effective than many other protein sources I considered.  My friends have noticed, my family has noticed, and my girlfriend doesn't exactly mind the extra muscle. ;)Overall, great product, I'll be sticking with this.

  I've been using Optimum Nutrition's Whey Protein for several years, and I absolutely love it.  I've used it on shakes, oatmeal, puddings, etc - anything that I can add a little extra protein and flavoring to.  The good thing is it's low cal, has 1g fat per serving, and very low sugar.The only downside is choosing the ""right"" flavor.  I recently bought the regular ""vanilla"" flavor, but it isn't as delicious as the others I've purchased.  My favorite flavors so far are Vanilla Ice Cream (!!!!), Banana Cream, and Chocolate Mint.  My least favorite - Cookies and Cream.  Tastes nothing like it, and it has a strong malt taste (which I don't like).  You may want to consider getting small sample pouches at GNC or Vitamin Shoppe so you can determine which taste suits you the most.Highly recommended product.

  I gave this 5 stars cause it mixes well, good ingredients, and taste fine. I usually mix the powder with a banana, and sometimes blend it with spinach (you can barely taste it, plus easiest way to get your vegetables in). Also, sometimes I'll throw some peanut butter in it. You can also mix it with almond milk if you wamt to sweeten it up. I recommend vanilla cause it mixes well with just about anything! If you want to make it a weight gainer, just grind up some oatmeal with a coffee grinder until it turns to powder and mix it.If you're looking for something with excellent taste and taste like candy, then you're really forgetting the point of a protein shake.

  Compared to non-whey powder this stuff mixes into liquid ridiculously easily.

  Finally No Artificial Ingredients And the Flavor is Great! This is my new GO TO whey, I am reviewing the Vanilla. It dissolved quickly in water, it wasn't grainy or chalking. This would be a great whey to add to shakes or yogurt as the taste is not overpowering or overly sweet. I would not hesitate to buy this again.

    If you are a clean, healthy eater, Natural Vanilla is delicious
  
","









  
  
    
  (I only want to address the taste of this product.  This is NOT a complete product review.)If you are a healthy, clean eater whose taste buds have not been twisted perverse by the abundance of salt and sugar in processed foods, ON Natural with ~3g of sugar per serving will taste delicious to you, if you choose to mix it with filtered water, almond milk, or cow's milk.If you belong to the 'if it fits your macronutrients, eat it' crowd and believe in 'dirty bulking,' it's likely your sense of taste is so off-kilter that this will be one of the grosser concoctions you've tasted that isn't green in color.  The non-Natural variety contains Splenda (sucralose) complete with all its repulsive aftertaste splendor and potential for throat irritation and other side effects.Natural vs artificial sweeteners and the difference of ~30 calories is what separates the two styles of ON Whey.  I've had a few flavors of both, and as someone who doesn't eat a lot of sugar in day to day life and eats no processed foods, I vastly prefer the natural but minimal sweetness of ON Natural Vanilla.  It still tastes good to me after six months of drinking it two to four times daily.

    My favorite brand of protein powder.
  
","









  
  
    
  I've tired three different flavors of ON's whey protein powder and I have to say, I'm not disappointed by any of them. So far the coffee flavor has been my absolute favorite (I'm a huge coffee fanatic). It mixes very well with almond milk for a delicious post-workout drink.I'm always impressed with how well their powders mix, even just using a shaker/blender bottle. I have never had a problem with lumpy protein when it comes to Optimum Nutrition, and I really think that's saying something. I've tried a lot of other brands and always have issues where the powder clumps and won't mix, but not here.One of the larger containers also lasts me several months and eases the burden on my wallet in the long run. I highly recommended their products!

  This protein is amazing. Its a very clean whey protein which doesn't contain any really artificial flavors. Its a light vanilla flavor, so for those who want more flavor, be sure to add milk to it. I drink it with just water because I like the light flavor. Highly recommend.

  I was skeptical of using a protein powder but read a few articles how it helps with weight loss and management. I don't have time to eat in the morning and my lunch is too short to sit down and eat. Now three months into using this product I am slowly seeing results. I drink this with 8 ounces of almond milk unsweetened in the morning, followed by a Musclepharm bar for lunch. If I'm hungry midday I drink another or eat another bar then have a regular dinner. On weekends, I eat two normal meals and drink the protein supplement for breakfast.  I only exercise lightly 3 times a week. I am losing 1lb a week and keeping it off. The drink keeps me full for three hours. The double rich chocolate with almond milk tastes like chocolate milk. There is no after taste and easily goes down. I do have to give it a good mix in my blender bottle because it clumps to the side. I tried making a shake by adding some fruits per suggestion but it wasn't that good. I prefer to drink it as a milk. I also bought vanilla flavor to change it out in the morning.

  If you want high quality protein 100% Whey Gold Standard is the way to go. I always go with vanilla flavor as I think it tastes better than others in water and in berry smoothies. It easily dissolves it water with a shaker and dissolves o.k.  with stirring.The Amino Acid profile is well balanced for the average person's needs. This is a great way to add enough protein in your diet for athletes and the everyday man/woman alike. I find that it helps me keep my diet more balanced and I am often in a better mood (AAs are used for a number of neurotransmitters).If you are looking for a well profiled high quality protein, this is your go to.

I prefer the natural vanilla, slightly sweet and not artificial tasting.  I usually mix it with fruit and some plain yogurt in the blender, delicious.  Worth the price.

  It is tasty and lasts a few months. I've ordered this twice now and since the June, I've gained about 8 to 10 pounds, mostly of muscle (with a new workout too). But it doesn't necessarily have to be used for weight gain, even though that's been my goal. Getting some extra protein in the diet really can't hurt, even if you're trying to lose weight.I recommend this for anyone who is starting to get serious about their fitness goals.

  My favorite protein for many years. No longer. Number of servings shrunk by 3. Not a big deal right? If you buy one of these a month over the course of a year you lose 36 servings - roughly equivalent to a 2lb container of ON whey ~$30. Sugar added, aminogen removed. I also note they removed reference to Hydrowhey as the source of the products whey peptides.Some will say all of these negative reviews are an overreaction, etc. Well, ON claims to be the ""gold standard"" in whey and should be judged accordingly.( also worth noting the curious spike in single sentence, 5 star ""fanboy"" type reviews around the time this and other negative but thoughtful reviews were written).

  I've seen so much positive review towards ON's brand in the past, and their products have turned out great.

  I've used Gold Standard for awhile, I'm assuming I've used the Artificially flavored version of this product until this one, which is Naturally flavored. I'm not sure what the issue is, it tastes okay going down but the after taste of this is god AWFUL. And I've seen some other poor reviews saying pretty much the same thing, sometimes you get a good container that tastes great other times it's horrible. Not even sure if it is working with how bad it tastes.
