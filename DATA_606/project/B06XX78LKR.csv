  I have a mixed opinion of this.  On the one hand, it dissolves well, keeps me satisfied, and has all the right nutritional stats for my purposes.  I feel that it’s good quality.On the other hand, the flavor (cake batter) is so insanely atrociously sweet, I can hardly stand it.  I mix it with three times as much water as called for, and still the sweetness is intolerable.  I’m hoping to be able to choke down the rest of the can, but it will be a struggle.I can’t have chocolate, so my flavor options are limited.  I generally like cake batter flavored ice cream, so I thought I would try this.  I won’t purchase it again.

  I love the flavor. It is so good. I love mixing it with yogurt as well. This is also wonderful on a low carb diet as long as you get the fat to make a great meal. I actually wouldn’t mind if this shake had a (Keto) version where it had at least 15 grams of fat, and keeping the 25 grams of protein. Keeping it the same just adding fat. I have lost over 80 lbs on Keto and I want dymatize to be part of that. I have tried so many other products and this one being so low carb is perfect. I have four flavors on my fridge. Thanks for making a great product.

  I've been having some gut issues lately and I'm shocked that this powder hasn't upset my stomach at all. The ingredients in most protein powders are really fake, but this one is as close as you can get to healthy ingredients when you count in taste and blend-ability. It blends so easily and smoothly with a blender bottle, and vanilla tastes great. I've bought this repeatedly for about two years now before writing this review - I can confidently state that for the value, this protein powder is the best I've ever had, and I've had quite a few as a weight lifter. I also use this in smoothies and the flavor isn't so strong that it tastes like an artificial drink. I will keep buying this for sure and I've already gifted this to others who also have come to love how easy this is on the stomach.

The first flavor i ever tired was chocolate and it was so good not as chalky and there was no weird after taste. I love how they both taste great with either water or almond milk.This is a review as well with a comparison of all the flavors i have tasted thus far.Chocolate-taste like chocolate milkCinnamon bun- taste like the cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk or if youve ever tasted horchata(cinnamon rice water)Birthday cake- i read a review that said it tasted like halo top birthday cake, spot on! Reminds me of sweet cream ice cream from marble slab but Not too sweet!Peanut butter chocolate- my new favorite!  Taste JUST like the little debby nutty bars.

  I saw someone online talking about this delicious protein powder. I usually order my Whey Isolate from a different company because of the macros. I hadn't been able to find anything that compared until now. This will now become a staple item in my protein cabinet. I loved how I could add water, almond milk, fruit, or anything and it didn't take away from the Fruity Pebble taste. I can't wait to try the Cocoa Pebbles.

  Absolutely the most amazing protein I have had. Taste JUST like fruity pebbles. It blends amazing even without a shaker bottle.The ingredients are top notch. Very delicious protein.I have also tried the chocolate Carmel, chocolate and the peanut butter from Dymatize. All amazing products. The peanut butter flavor taste like peanut better fudge.

  This is a must try flavor. My previous other flavors are gourmet vanilla (not my favorite) gourmet chocolate (very good), birthday cake ( very good, it’s a sweeter version of a vanilla). The Orange dreamsicle is Very good.  Taste like the frozen orange dreamsicles you had as a kid. My favorite now is the fudge brownie.

  We love this protein. We’ve tried several brand of whey protein and have settled on this one. We have tried this in both chocolate and vanilla I highly recommend both. The vanilla we mix into our smoothies and it gives a healthy added boost of protein to a fruit smoothie. The chocolate we normally just mix with water but it taste like a chocolate milkshake. Hope this review was helpful let me know if you have any questions!

  I’m writing this review because I’m the person who loves to try new protein powders but ends up getting crappy tasting products or they are very chalky or dont mix well or just overall suck. LISTEN TO ME. This product is hands down my favorite mix powder I have ever tasted. I have tried Sparta loopy whey and others who should taste like fruity pebbles. And NOTHING has ever tasted this good. I always lose my mixing ball as well and end up with chalky drink, not with this powder. I mixed it with water and my drink my was smooth and no clumps at the bottom or top. honestly the best part is there are pieces of fruity pebbles in this. I’m telling you. This is an amazing product. Buy it

  I purchased the Natural Vanilla flavor. Do not change this recipe by any means, this is going to be my new protein that I use! Has a great natural taste and smell of vanilla. All other protein powders that are vanilla I've tried haven't smelled as real as this. Great blending flavor, not overpowering or fake tasting, but really good tasting. Uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners is a big pro. Only bought the 1.6Lb to try, but next time I will buy the 5Lb... the current price of $0.84/ounce is well priced for the 5Lb, as long as the price stays the same, this will be my go to.

  HOLY. COW. I had a gastric bypass RNY two years ago, and protein shakes are still something that I fall back on frequently when I'm too busy or too lazy to think about food in a more proactive way. My husband (who just likes protein shakes, no bariatric surgery for him) and I were getting SO. BORED. of chocolate and vanilla flavors. It's actually surprisingly difficult to find protein powders with a good protein/carb ratio, and 90% of the market is flooded with vanilla and protein. All we needed to see for this product were the carb count, and the magical words ""Fruity pebbles"".So let's cut to the chase. The 1.6 pound tub came in last week, and we are now talking about ordering the 5 pound tub because WOW. Not only is this an easy and good thing for me as a bariatric patient to consume, but it TASTES. SO. GOOD. I can't taste ANY of the normal ""protein-y"" flavor. I'm not waking up in the morning saying ""ugh, no time for eggs, I guess I'll have a protein shake"". I'm waking up, and I'm excited for my protein shake, which is better than the eggs because I can actually finish 25 g of protein in a shake, but not in eggs.We're going to be recording, and trying new flavors too. So. Excited.

  As someone who was raised on Fruity Pebbles, it's baffling to me how much the flavor tastes just like it. 5 stars alone for the taste, I can't speak on the quality of the protein as I haven't noticed any difference otherwise from some of the other brands i've tried.

I thought nothing major of it, so I opened the lid to find the inner seal broken like it was scratched. Almost half of the container was empty as I said it felt light, I doubt it was the full 5 lbs that I ordered. Immediately returned it, I am so disappointed as this has never happened before.

Mixing it with water is okay, but when you mix it with milk it actually tastes like the sugary milk once you're done with cereal. It's absolutely amazing!

  Pretty good, but needs a balancer for the stevia (such as monk fruit).  Dymatize is a trust brand, with tons of BCAA and Leucine.  Also, low in calories and sugar.  Plus you are getting what you are paying for since it is all Isolate (not getting a blend or concentrate).  I am used to stevia, but just couldn't get over the taste of the vanilla and chocolate in my smoothies and overnight oats.  I noticed in their sucralose sweetened version, they replaced the acesulfame potassium with stevia, so I will be switching back to that one.  If you can hack the taste, then I highly recommend.

  I have used this product before and I think it’s a super great protein. Delivery and product was a smooth process! I think the protein itself is good compare to other slower acting ones and the taste isn’t too bad. I usually mix it with my creatine and EAAs, so that helps.

  I was on the fence of buying this protein because I thought it wouldn’t live up to the hype or reviews. Every protein powder that I’ve tasted, that has a “fun” flavor always had a protein-y aftertaste or missed the mark completely. This on the other hand is the best tasting protein I’ve ever tasted. Seriously.This protein powder tastes just like a bowl of fruity pebbles with milk. There’s no weird aftertaste and it mixes better than most proteins. There were some chunks but nothing major.If you’re on the fence like I was, just buy it. I honestly look forward to drinking this after my workouts now.

  Okay.I purchased this for muscle gain, I've been using various whey powders for the last 2 years. Initially I purchased this because it was hydrolyzed, I wanted a protein powder that would be easier on my stomach and didn't cause as much acne. Every powder I've ever had I did not use for the taste, I'd just shoot them like a shot and for this reason was a chore for me. I purchased the cocoa pebbles and let me tell you! It tastes exactly like the milk from the cereal when made with WATER! I look forward to getting a protein shake now and have already made hot cocoa with it. It hasn't been long enough to see if it affects my skin like the others have, but it has caused my zero gastrointestinal problems. A+ product 🤗

  Love this protein powder. I wanted to find a more unique flavor because I drink these twice a day and Fruity Pebbles was exactly that. If I wanted to I would mix it in my cereal milk (but I don’t eat cereal so). Love and recommend this powder.

  I’ve tried 4 different flavors and I’ll review each individually, because I use them differently.  As a whole, though, I like these proteins as I find the ingredients and macros to be pretty good and prefer whey isolate proteins.  I have also had no issue with any of them mixing into liquids or being clumpy, as I’ve encountered with other proteins.Listed in order of preference.Cinnamon Bun: Definitely my favorite of the flavors I’ve tried.  I started with a 1lb tub, found out I loved it and bought a 5lb tub.  I’ve finished that as well and am on to the next one.  I originally purchased this to make protein pancakes, but I couldn’t get the texture right.  Eventually I started adding it to my oatmeal and OH MY GOSH.  Drizzle a little peanut butter on top and just wow.  It’s so damn good.  My only complaints are a: it definitely needs more cinnamon.  I always add extra when using this, no matter how if it’s in oatmeal, mug cake, etc. and b: it definitely had an artificial sweetener taste.  I personally have limited tolerance to actual sugar, so for me it’s not a problem.  But I could see it being for someone more sensitive.Birthday Cake: I read reviews before deciding to purchase a 1lb tub to try this.  Overall, I think the reviews are correct.  It’s similar to halo top birthday cake ice cream, but honestly I’ve never just mixed this with water or milk and drank it, so maybe it would taste more similar if I did.  As with the cinnamon bun, I just mix this in with oatmeal and drizzle with peanut butter.  Just make sure to make the oatmeal on the liquid-y side because the protein powder absorbs a lot of the liquid.  It definitely has an artificial, overly sweetened vanilla taste, but I think that’s bomb in my oatmeal.Double Chocolate: It’s not my favorite chocolate protein, but it’s not bad.  It mixes nicely into milk if you put it in a shaker bottle.  The previously mentioned proteins are so tasty that I haven’t tried this one mixed into my oatmeal, only as it’s own drink.  And one time I tried to make a mug cake but it was awful.  That may have been the recipe I used, though.Orange Dreamsicle: This one is a little difficult for me.  You have to really be in the mood.  It definitely nails the orange creamsicle flavor.  Thing is, I just don’t think that flavor is for me.  Maybe it was too many orange creamsicle drinks in college, I’m not sure.  And I can’t figure out another use for it.  I don’t think it would be good in oatmeal or baked with, so I’m just kind of sitting with half a tub trying to figure out how not to waste it.

   This will be a little long winded. I love Dymatize ISO 100 protein powder. It is the only protein I have used for over 3 years. I typically buy the fudge brownie and the gourmet chocolate flavors because I am not a fan of vanilla protein powders. I ordered birthday cake, cinnamon bun, and fruity pebbles in the 1.6 lb containers to sample and a 5 lb container of fudge brownie since I can always trust chocolate. This powder does not have the same consistency as any of the previous containers I have bought from a brick and mortar store like GNC or local supplement shop. This powder seems to be very fluffy and not a very fine granule like it usually is. The powder also does not mix as well and creates a layer of foam on top of the shake when I shake it in my blender bottle. It also seems to be a bit more watery than usual. I dislike the taste of the birthday cake; it tastes like a bad vanilla powder and as previously stated I dislike vanilla protein so there is some bias there. The cinnamon bun powder also seemed to be fluffy, when blended there were chunks floating around, and the cinnamon settles to the bottom of the shake. The cinnamon bun tastes much better and seemed to be less watery, but still creates a foamy layer on top of the shake. The labels also seemed to have some imperfections which isn't a big deal but leads me to question the quality since it is something I've never noticed with previous purchases. I haven't received the fruity pebbles flavor and haven't opened the fudge brownie container yet, but I will try to remember to update this post when I do.With all of the inconsistencies in these protein powders I am not 100% certain that these have ACTUALLY been manufactured by dymatize. These products were shipped to the middle east where I am currently deployed, but the protein powder I brought with me did not have this issue from flying. I will not purchase these from Amazon again and feel pretty sketch about consuming them, but will be buying the cinnamon bun, atleast, when I return to the USA to do a quality comparison.HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE. JUST GO BUY THESE PRODUCTS FROM A REPUTABLE RETAILER IF YOU CAN.

  I am relatively new to drinking protein powder. I've tried the Dymatize Cocoa Pebbles chocolate, and some other brands' vanilla ice cream flavor.  The chocolate is VERY GOOD, and the other brands' vanilla is just ok at best.  This orange cream is THE BEST and all it takes is water, and ice and some hard shaking.  I think you'll really enjoy it!  I wish Dymatize had a ""sampler"" to buy so we could try all of the flavors before we buy the tubs.

  Can't comment on the nutritional value, and taste is always subjective.  Plus it depends, of course, on what you mix the powder with and how much you use.  (I prefer about 150 ml of semi-skimmed milk per scoop.)  Anyway, here are my impressions so far, from the good to the not so good:* Cinnamon Bun.  My favorite.  Not too sweet, actually close to a cinnamon bun flavor, and I didn't tire of the taste even after working my way through the jar.* Gourmet Chocolate.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of chocolate drinks, I did like this.  More dark than milk chocolate flavor.* Fruity Pebbles.  This gets lots of rave reviews.  I suppose if you had the cereal as a kid it's a nostalgia trip.  I didn't, and I could barely drink it.  Cloying, awful after taste.  I was able to make it less dreadful by mixing it with crushed cooked strawberries.  But even that didn't work for long.  I ended up throwing half the jar away.Despite my experience with Fruity Pebbles, I'm looking forward to some of the other flavors.

I think it would still be good with 2x the amount of milk/water it suggests, which is good because it recommends 4oz to a scoop. It didn't taste exactly like I expected it too, but it does taste like cake! It's very good, not chalky at all.

  Ok, I know protein powders usually have an aftertaste and the use of sweeteners instead of real sugar is good for those who want to cut carbs, but after reading many reviews about the birthday cake flavor being so great I purchased it but it honest, it tastes like medicine.

  To be honest, This whey protein would have been much better if it wasn't too sweet. Even though it says 2 sugar per service, you tastes sugary flavor more than the chocolate flavor.

It’s by far one of the best tasting chocolate protein powders I have ever tried. I’ve had a lot of bad ones in my days.

  Pretty good, but needs a balancer for the stevia (such as monk fruit).  Dymatize is a trust brand, with tons of BCAA and Leucine.  Also, low in calories and sugar.  Plus you are getting what you are paying for since it is all Isolate (not getting a blend or concentrate).  I am used to stevia, but just couldn't get over the taste of the vanilla and chocolate in my smoothies and overnight oats.  I noticed in their sucralose sweetened version, they replaced the acesulfame potassium with stevia, so I will be switching back to that one.  If you can hack the taste, then I highly recommend.

  I’ve been working out consistently and supplementing for about 5 years. Tried plenty or products, was recommended this particular brand and flavor by a friend. Could be that the package was left in a hot truck/the sun a little too long, but the smell was not good after opening.Expiration date was good, so I went ahead with using it after workouts till the container was done. Each time I was greeted with a vague smell of plastic and stale fruity flavor. You would think the flavor would be horrible, but it actually tasted pretty much like fruity pebbles.Unfortunately, because of the smell, it still made the overall experience of using this product unpleasant. If you’re looking for good flavor, while its pretty spot on when you drink it, the smell takes a lot away. Would not recommend.

  The best protein powder ever you can find in the market. Taste amazing!!! Great quality ingredients. Especially, strawberry flavor is the most delicious one. Powder goes with cold Vitamin D milk and little bit of cold water. You can workout just to drink this protein shake!!!

  I have been having a lot of stomach issues with other proteins ive tried. I read about ISO 100 and decided to give it a try. I got the vanilla bean flavor and it is the first time ive had such a tasty protein. It taste simile to the vanilla bean frap at starbucks. I hope this protein does not make my stomach hurt. Will be updating next week...

  This review is for the Fruity Pebbles flavor.  Dymatize ISO 100 has always been solid for ingredient quality and ease of blending even without a shaker ball.  I purchased the Fruity Pebbles flavor as a joke for my workout partner but found that the flavor is _really_ good -- it tastes just like fruit cereal in milk.  Vanilla is also great, but there are many companies that make a solid vanilla.  Not bitterness, not aftertaste, a perfect protein supplement!

  Flavor: StrawberryLook if you want a protein that tastes like rich strawberry’s and has that emphasis on strawberry flavor then seriously consider buying this. Mixes perfect, and tastes exactly like strawberry’s. Lately I’ve been doing 2 cups almond milk, 4 large strawberry’s, 2 scoops with some ice and a splash of ice water. Perfect strawberry taste

  I was really kinda scared to taste this. I mean, Fruity Pebbles Protein Shake??? A healthy version of my favorite sugar filled breakfast cereal??? Not to mention that I had to switch to Almond Milk recently, and I already knew I didn't really care for that. But, I bought it anyways. I made one and tried really hard to get my husband or my daughter or anyone else to test it for me, but they refused. So, I took a deep breath and took a drink. Mind blown! Reminds me of drinking the milk after eating a bowl of Fruity Pebbles! And it doesn't have that powder residue aftertaste that some protein shakes tend to have. I can have my sugar breakfast packed with protein, without the sugar and carbs! I'm thrilled! I'll be buying the Cocoa Pebbles next.

  Firstly I love Dymatize especially the classic chocolate.  The Birthday cake I'm unsure about the flavour,  I dont love it or dont hate it. I'm giving it a 3 star as it shows on the product label on the  Amazon listing as  0  lactose and on the container it says 0.5 lactose . This is the second container different flavors that's said 0 lactose on the website and got it on the container when I've recieved it.  The last one made my stomach hurt , I've only had one serving of this one and been ok up to press. In saying that the flavors of Dymatize are about the best you can get for protien powder and I've had quite a few different brands and flavors.

  I have mixed feelings about this protein powder. I've tried the fudge brownie and the orange flavors. I found both to be overly sweet but I don't have a big sweet tooth in general, so they might be fine for others. Both flavors were still drinkable though and not bad, just not up my alley. That said I also have not tried another brand in years so the taste might be comparable to others. One reason I chose this brand was that reviews said it was easy on the stomach (I have nausea issues sometimes) and I would have to agree. I never had issues there. The powder also dissolves well; I typically just mix it with water. I've found that if I put it in a water bottle and add a couple ice cubes and shake, it dissolves really well. So overall even if the taste isn't my personal favorite it's a solid product.

  I normally use Isopure Protein Powder, which doesn’t have any real or artificial sugar, but wanted to try a new flavor. Bought this due to the reviews. It is insanely sweet. Science has proven that the body reacts the same way to both real and artificial sugar; it causes an increase in fat cells. This is great if you are a body builder or cancer patient and need to put on weight. This is not what you want if you are like me and want to loose weight and get in shape. Too bad they don’t make a sugar free product. Threw it all in the trash.

  * This review only pertains to the packaging/volume of substance , not the quality of the product itself.I purchased this product seeing this as a ""top-tier"" item/brand, and I was looking for a ""premium"" whey protein for my workouts. There are many options out there that provide more volume at a lower cost.When I opened this ""premium"" product, my surprise was only surpassed by my disappointment.About 1/4, if not more, of the container is empty. I understand that I should expect some emptiness but this is alarmingly excessive: especially when considering that this company is charging more per oz than majority of other Whey companies on Amazon.I would recommend all to take this in consideration if this product will be a ""bang for your buck"". For me, it is not.

  A lot easier buying this here than going to the nutrition store where they try to push all of their pills and powders on you from the second you walk in.

  I've tried brand after brand because either the protein powder is too sweet, causes horrible GI issues, makes me sick, or it just tastes terrible.

I'm still in shock! It's not too sweet, zero clumps/ blends extremely well, didn't cause GI issues and tastes just like fruity pebbles cereal milk.  The sodium/ potassium amounts are low, which is amazing for me.  I've mixed it with plain water & half water/ half almond milk.  I do prefer the latter, but both methods have a great outcome.I've lost a lot of muscle due to my protein intake being less than what it should be, so I definitely needed this.  For the first time, I had 2 shakes yesterday & powered through my workout.  It'll take time to get to where I want to be, but I'm very happy with this purchase! My kid even likes this one!

  First off let me say that the product blends extremely well, even in water; Ok on to the next.To the manufacuters of blended anything, if you make more than one flavor of any product that is purposed to be blended please provide smaller packs of the products so that the consumer can have the ability to taste your blends.  It is not cost effective for the consumer to guess what your product will taste like by reading reviews.This product os just too sweet for me. I'm a diabetic and I love that it is sugar free but I'm disappointed because I'm out of $26. What if I had paid $50 or $60 for a larger quantity of powder and this happened. If there was a variety pack available it was not suggested and was not found when I put whey protein powder in the search bar.Ive tried to look past the sweetness and used it a few times which is a bummer because I cant send it back. I much rather had spent my money on a variety pack. Then later spent my money on the flavor that appealed to me.

  Flavor is wonderful.  I mix mine with FAGE Total Yogurt; it,(the yogurt only has 5g's of sugar per serving with no ""added"" sugar); SORRY: sounds like a review for the yogurt!  :-(  Point is, I eat a keto based diet and mixing the Dymatize ISO 100 Protein powder with it makes for a wonderful ""pudding"" which serves as a great ""healthy"" desert with the benefit of added protein which has helped me reduce body fat and gain muscle mass; not an easy thing to do at my age.  THAT'S ALL FOLKS!

  So before my purchase, i read the reviews from 5 stars to 1 stars and viewed the images posted. I became hesitant to purchase but i had previously bought the cinnamon bun flavor at a vitaminshop and i was very satisfied. I decided to go with my gut feeling and purchase this flavor for i heard many great reviews and LET ME TELL YOU! It smells DELICIOUS. .Now i posted the tub to show everyone how this might look like a rip off because it looks half empty BUT I WEIGHED IT and it's exactly what you're buying!!! The window strip for visibility is there for helpful tricks not to show the buyers it's supposed to be completely full...i weighed the product and it does give me the 725g  of protein it states, my scale indicates 880g only because it's considering the weoght of the tub as well. It even says on the product ""sold by weight not by volume""IM VERY PLEASED! THANKS.

  That stuff sweet af so if you enjoy food that make you feel like you’ll get diabetes but you don’t actually want diabetes then the birthdays cake flavor is perfect for you! (The sweetness over powers the cake flavor but its still there). I dont hate it like the other reviewers do but they were right on how sweet it is. Birthday cake is a 2.5/5 not bad but not great.For cinnamon bun, its pretty good it indeed does feel like a horchata in your mouth if you mix it with water. Cinnamon bun is a 4/5

  Having gone through many variations of brand, price, protein type, and flavors, Dymatize hits the mark on all of them. Blends instantly in a shaker, tastes really good (like Frankenberry cereal milk), great price by comparison, and NO bloating whatsoever. A little part of me would like it to be pink, but that would be artificial flavors, so I got over it. Will look to the casein next to balance out the intake plan.Pretty sure once the canisters of the others are used up (or given away), I'll be switching to Dymatize exclusively.

  This powder melted into nothing. No clumps, bumps, or powder left undissolved. I will say the gourmet vanilla, even for an extreme sweet tooth, was so overwhelmingly artificially sweetened that it made me feel sick drinking alone. I mixed a small amount with a whole cup of bitter greens and it was still so sweet it took away ALL the bitterness of the greens. I had to put plain sour tasting yogurt, STILL TOO SWEET. Used natural unsweetened peanut butter. STILL TOO SWEET. Then I added an entire spoon of 100% cocoa powder and it finally neutralized the sweetness. What a nightmare! I would get this brand again but I’m too afraid of the other vanilla being too sweet. I started just putting this powder in pancakes to sweeten them and it adds a little more nutritional value with them

  A little backstory:I couldn't figure out why my tummy was always so gross feeling after working out. I had the bubbles, the gurgles, the groans... sometimes gastrointestinal distress that could clear a barn. It was... unfriendly. Little did I know, some powders don't mix well with Acid Reflux. So I went looking for a gentler, GERD-friendly complex that most importantly, could not contain almonds. I came across Dymatize... and cake?Fast forward: I've been using this product for a month now, and I cannot... CANNOT get over how great it is!There's no chalky taste, it smells heavenly, it absorbs beautifully, and it's really versatile. Best of all-- no more GI issues!I'm all about trying the cinnabun mix next!It can have a few chunks, so if you're a texture person, put it in your shaker cup and mix letting it sit for about 30 mins before adding your blender ball in. Unlike other formulas, I've found this has fixed the small clumps.Also, I don't always need the full amount so I use a shaker cup and either 1/2 scoop with 6oz of 1% milk or a whole scoop in 9 oz of milk. For a fun treat, I put some in a little chocolate milk and it's a party!Listen, if other protein powders bother your tummy, try this! I promise you won't be disappointed!

  In a lot of the reviews, it has people stating that Fruity Pebbles is sooo good and it's the best flavor. I was skeptical. I stuck to other flavors...always getting tired of them after about a week...always having to add things to them just to tolerate them. But not Fruit Pebbles! It's just like drinking the milk after a bowl of most fruity cereals. It never gets old. And when it's cold, i can drink it all day if i had to. You could mix it in with your milk when you eat fruity cereals. At this point, i don't plan on drinking any other flavor ever again.

  I was very impressed with this product the first few times I used it. It blended amazingly and tasted delicious. Fruity Pebbles is one of my favorite cereals but I haven’t had it in forever because it’s basically pure sugar so I was ecstatic to find this product. However, something in this product gives me horrible gas and loose stools. I know it’s not the whey or the milk I mix it in with because I consumed plenty of dairy before this and I’ve used milk with other whey protein powders and had zero issues. I’d recommend it to a friend but after mine is gone I, unfortunately, won’t be using it again. :(

Compared to this protein powder the other one tasted horrible when I would add it to my overnight oats or Greek yogurt parfaits. The nutrition facts on this powder far outweigh the cheaper one I bought and many others from my comparisons. The taste also is way better by adding sweetness without the chemical taste. I don’t do reviews often unless there is some kind of benefit for me, but after making my mistake and realizing that I made the right choice the first time I thought I would try to help others who might be looking for a lower calorie, low fat, low cholesterol and great tasting protein powder. Needless to say I learned my lesson and will not be trying to change a good thing.

  The flavor on this when mixed with milk tastes just like an ice cream push pop and is very sweet.

This is only my second container of protein powder so I'm still learning, but the other major downside is that you can't mix this with much.  I like to add the protein powder in with baked goods / pancakes / coffee and this flavor does not go well with much.

In some people with diabetes Whey can cause significant sugar spikes. I am disappointed as it has good reviews in general and it tasted really good, but the spike it caused is indicative of a food supplement not recommended for diabetics (more than 20 points after 1 hour). I will have to try a Casein only powder as I do need the protein supplement in my diet.

The quality of the powder is amazing, the taste is amazing, and it is so easy to digest. Very light on digestion and tastes exactly like the actual cereal! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone because it’s very high quality protein for an affordable price. Definitely will be getting more of this in the future!

  From reading the reviews you already know that this protein powder is one of the best. I love how easy and delicious it tastes. Don't let ""peanut butter"" bother you because it actually just tastes like a chocolate shake. The only downside to this is drinking the longterm is that it may cause breakouts. It happened to me so if that happens to you, I recommend looking into other brands. I would rotate and come back to this because of the taste, but I can't drink this longterm :/

  Finally decided to try this flavor. Going in my expectatuons were not too high due to some mixed review. The flavor when mixed with milk is no different than the milk at the bottom of a bowl of fruity pebbles. I was blown away by the flavor. In the future I really hope they can collab with other cereals too... Mayne cinnamon toast crunch? In the meantime this is one of my new favorite flavors.

  If you’re trying to cut back on sugar in your diet, this protein powder is going to taste REALLY sweet. Even though it doesn’t contain added sugars per se, it does contain stevia, which I think tastes sweeter than sugar and weirdly metallic. I can’t comment on the effectiveness of this protein powder since I just tried it in a couple of shakes, I will say it blends easily, and the vanilla flavor is good, just way too sweet for my tastes.

  I've tried many proteins and flavors. I wanted something new. There were many reviews about the orange dreamsicle being great, so I ordered that and the birthday cake. I should have listened to the reviews about the sweetness. They are so sweet I can't stomach them. I can barely taste the flavor over the sweetness. It's not only nauseating but it gives me a headache. If you want a good tasting protein, the Syntrax Nectar Strawberry Mousse with Almond or Regular milk is amazing -- tastes just like strawberry milk. Any of the Syntrax flavors are amazing...this was just disappointing.

    Fruity Pebbles Flavor is Good, but has a chemical aftertaste
  
","









  
  
    
  I ordered the fruity pebbles flavor, and it did taste like real fruity pebbles. They really nailed the flavor there, but there is a chemical taste mixed up in there as well and I am surprised no-one is talking about it. I made mine with milk and it was really smooth and milky like with a fruity pebbles taste. The good news is that the aftertaste can be EASILY masked if you add some additional ingredient to it such as sweetened cocoa powder, peanut butter, or fruit. This protein powder doesn't have that protein taste and it's not thick. I really like it, so I will use this powder as a vanilla base and just add things to it. I just wish there wasn't that chemical taste to the drink by itself because I could drink it better then.

There's hardly any cinnamon taste. I haven't found anything that compares to MyProtein's cinnamon roll flavor, which is now sadly discontinued.My vanilla protein powder with a dash of ground cinnamon tastes more like cinnamon bun than Dymatize's.

    Great powder; cinnamon bun is absolutely disgusting
  
","









  
  
    
  This powder is great, mixes easily, and tastes great depending on the flavor. For reference, I mix it with unsweet soy milk. Here's the flavors I've tried from best to worst.The chocolate peanut butter flavor is probably the best tasting powder I've ever tried. Tastes exactly like drinking a butterfinger bar. Not overly sweet to me either, and with the peanut butter balancing out the flavor I can pretty much drink it every day without getting tired of it.The gourmet chocolate is a great chocolate flavor. Compared to Optimum Nutrition Gold double rich chocolate, it's sweeter and richer, but that also makes it easier for me to get tired of it. Great at first, but for daily drinking I still prefer the more muted and less sweet chocolate flavor of Optimum Nutrition's powder.Unfortunately the cinnamon bun flavor is absolutely disgusting and currently holds the title of the worst tasting powder I've ever tried. Way, way too sweet. Painfully sweet. And I mix my shakes pretty thin, with about double the amount of liquid they recommend. I cannot imaging what this would taste like at recommended concentration. I bought a small sized container of this flavor after seeing another review compare the taste to horchata, and after trying it I really don't agree. Even looking past the intolerable sweetness, it's definitely more savory, like an actual cinnamon bun, than horchata.If it wasn't for the cinnamon bun flavor, I probably would have given this powder five stars. It's actually quite puzzling to me, because I cannot imagine any company actually making a powder that tastes so incredibly bad. And some of the reviews say they love it, but a lot of them also agree with me, so maybe it was recently reformulated? Or maybe it was a bad batch, either improperly mixed or with too much sweetener, that is the source of all the bad cinnamon bun reviews. Or maybe there's some yet-unknown genetic variance that makes some people like it, while making it intolerable for others. Your guess is as good as mine.

  I can’t say enough good things about this protein powder! I have tried multiple ones before this and I’m always disappointed. I’m especially not a chocolate flavor kinda person and typically go for more vanilla based, so I knew I had to try the birthday cake flavor. Let me tell you, it’s been life changing! It’s the right amount of sweet and you can’t even tell you’re drinking protein powder. Not to mention, the macros are phenomenal on this one. Please buy!

You can add ice or yogurt to thicken it up, which is also delicious. I even put sprinkles on top of my shakes as an extra treat!

  In my opinion this is one of the best protein products on the market. It tastes great, mixes easily and is relatively “clean”. It’s good as a pre, post and even intra workout shake. The Orange Dreamsicle flavor is a great departure from the typical chocolate, vanilla or strawberry flavors. Dymatize has been around for quite some time and makes quality products. Give it a try. You won’t be disappointed.

  This was my first adventure into protein shakes. Previously to add the additional protein I needed into my diet I was eating pure protein bars. So far I’ve not regret switching to this product.This product contains a variety of aminos and important additives to help with building muscular weight. This is something I’ve not experienced with the protein bars and have noticed an impact.The taste is great, I purchased the chocolate flavor and it is very sweet and good tasting. The powder itself mixed very well with water and provided a smooth drinking experience without noticeable chunks.I had explored other options and found that many included questionable ingredients and did not seem ideal for my picky eating preferences. I enjoy the hydrolyzed whey and the trust the additives.Overall I enjoy this product for daily shakes and intend to purchase more later.

","









  
  
    
  First of all, this is still my favorite and to go protein brand & flavor of all times. However, the last 1.6 lbs tub that I purchased was far from what I have been accustomed to.  First, upon opening the container, I noticed that the protein was unusually clumpy. I am not talking a few here and there that can be crumbled up by a simple shake of the container. Nope, there were lots of them in all shapes and sizes.  I remember joking to myself that maybe I had gotten the granola flavor by mistake.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and decided that maybe it had been sitting upright for a long time. I closed the container and gave it some strong shakes and taps against my kitchen counter. It did not get rid of the clumps but at least made them smaller. Then, when I prepared my shake with it, another surprise. Typically, when I begin the blending it starts getting all frothy and rises up to the top of my blender shake cup. So much so, that it looks like it will explode if I do not stop blending it. Not this time. It was totally flat! I drank it anyway. Taste was normal but again, it tasted flat. I decided to finish off the amount I had from my previous purchase. Still had enough for about a week and a half.(purchased this one because I could not pass up the $5 coupon discount to the already lowered price of $29.99) When I came back to this one, argh! I opened the container and it smelled spoiled. I could not believe it but was not surprised. Looked at the expiration date and it is still good.  I am not taking my chances with it. So disappointed that I am going to have to throw it away.  First time in almost 9 years that this has happened to me with this brand. Maybe the stock has been sitting around for a while from the particular vendor that I received it from. I think I will wait to purchase again until it is at regular price again. This time, the savings turned into loses.  Please not that my rating is strictly for this particular purchase.

  Throughout the years I have had many protein shakes, even some from Dymatize (some good some bad, and very bad). But this is by far and away the best protein shake I've ever had.

Outside of the taste, the product is great and mixes well like everyone says. *personal recommendation, try purchasing an item like this from a nearby health/supplement store first. If for some reason that you don't like the product you can return it and get something else in exchange on the spot atleast at the places that I talked to after.I will be trying to reach out to Amazon and the supplier to see if I can exchange it.

    I've had 9 flavors, here are my thoughts.
  
","









  
  
    
  Dymatize ISO100 has hands down become my go-to protein powder.  I have now tried 9 flavors, they are (in no particular order):- Chocolate Caramel- Chocolate Peanut Butter- Cinnamon Bun- Cocoa Pebbles- Cookie and Cream- Fudge Brownie- Gourmet Chocolate- Gourmet Vanilla- StrawberryThere are really four main factors that matter to me in a protein powder; How well does it mix, What's actually in it, how much does it cost, and the most important factor of all, taste.1) How well does it mix:It mixes great, zero complaints on this front.  It borderline mixes too well.  I typically have my protein in one of two ways; a shaker bottle with a metal shaker, mixed with water or milk, or a protein shake/smoothie mixed in a ninja blender.  In both situations, I have zero issues with the mix.  Never comes out clumpy or lumpy.  Some of the flavors mix so well they come out very foamy (more so than other powders) and I actually have to wait a bit so I'm not just drinking bubbles.2) What's in it?:I am not a supplement expert, but Dymatize's ISO100 has significantly less cholesterol than a lot of competitors, and that's good enough for me.  This factor matters the least to me, I don't look too much into ingredient labels, but heart disease does run in my family, so avoiding unnecessary cholesterol, which is common in a lot of powders, is a big plus.3) Cost:I think the price is exceptional for the product.  Sometimes there will be great deals here on Amazon for specific flavors.  I will get to it in the next section, but even though I do not think Dymatize has the hands-down best flavors, for the cost I couldn't be happier.4) Taste:THE BIG ONE!!!  Gourmet Chocolate is without question my absolute favorite chocolate flavored protein powder.  Totally subjective obviously, but I don't think anything else even really comes close, and I've tried a pretty extensive selection of chocolates.  For a reference point that a lot of people can relate to, I do not like Optimum Nutrition's chocolate at all, I think it's pretty disgusting.I am giving an overall rating of 4 stars because aside from gourmet chocolate and cookies and cream, I do not think any of the other flavors I've tried are out of this world.  Look above for the list of all the chocolate variants I've had.  I won't bother buying any of them again, because the gourmet chocolate is just plain better than all of the others.  The flavor difference is minimal enough that I don't care for them to add variety, but big enough that I see no reason to waiver from the king.Chocoloate Peanut Butter is an outlier on the chocolates, It's really good too, BUT when I want a chocolate peanut butter flavor, I think it tastes way better to just use gourmet chocolate, and then add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter powder, like PB Fit.  It's a small amount more calories for a lot more protein and a much less artificial flavor.Cookies and Cream is my second favorite.  It's also super delicious.  Now that I've experimented with most of the flavors, I will probably just be buying cookies and cream and gourmet chocolate, so that I don't get bored of one.Gourmet vanilla and cinnamon bun are fine.  If you really like those flavors I have no complaints.Strawberry I could not get to taste good in a smoothie.  Just wouldn't sit right with me.  Mixed with just almond milk it's pretty yummy though.  I got pretty tired of this flavor pretty fast and will likely not buy it again.  I'm generally not crazy about fruit flavored protein powders though.So, I didn't give 5 stars because not every flavor is my favorite.  What is you might ask?  I really love Ghost Protein.  I think they have the best flavors if you want 3 or more choices.  Their coffee flavor is my favorite protein of all time.  BUT, Ghost is a lot more expensive.  The ISO100 makes me a lot happier when I remember I'm spending quite a bit less per scoop (I usually buy the 3 lb tubs of ISO100, which is obviously cheaper per oz).  It just comes down to price to performance, and right now ISO100 wins it for me.  I still buy Ghost from time to time because I like it so much.Just for funsies here is my fairly generic protein smoothie I have almost every morning for my breakfast.1 scoop of either Gourmet Chocolate -or- Cookies and Cream ISO100.3/4 cup milk2 tablespoons peanut butter powder (I like PB Fit)1 whole frozen banana1/4-1/2 cup frozen black coffee ice cubes (you can of course just use regular ice cubes)About 35-40g of protein for a 350-400 calorie smoothie that tastes BANGIN.If you try it out, blend the milk, PB powder, and protein together first.  Then add the coffee ice cubes and blend for 30 seconds to a minute.  Then add the banana and blend to desired thickness, another 30 seconds - 1 minute. If you try to do it all at once, there are too many cold ingredients and the protein and PB powder won't blend as well as it normally would otherwise.OBLIGATORY FINAL SENTENCE IN ALL CAPS ABOUT GETTING THEM GAINZZZ.

  The fruity pebbles flavor tastes really good. The amount you get is deceptive as the weight includes their unnecessarily large heavy plastic container. It's basically half full. It also has soy in it which is a negative.

  I got the fruity pebble flavor. It is so good!! I love this protein powder! I'm so happy I found it.  It blends and dissolves very well. In the picture I mixed it in a blender bottle, but it didn't have the blender ball in it. I'm very impressed. Good flavor, no weird tastes, no chunks!

  I thought the other reviews were exaggerating but it really does taste exactly like the leftover milk after a yummy bowl of fruity pebbles / froot loops! It's so good trust me and the best part is you can mix it with out any milk (just with water) and it still tastes great. It mixes very well. I also tried Cocoa pebbles which still mixes well just not as well as the fruity pebbles for some reason, but Cocoa pebbles is also excellent, exactly like leftover milk after a bowl of cocoa pebbles. I've already repurchased and I probably will make this my main milk based protein supplement.

  I was hesitant to try to the fruity pebble flavor because I wasn't too sure what to expect. I love the cereal, but was worried the flavor would be too artificial or sweet. Let me tell you- the flavor is spot on to what you'd get from drinking the milk after a bowl of fruity pebbles. I use it with Chobani vanilla oat milk and it is absolutely amazing! A very subtly sweet & decadent flavor, it satisfies my sweet tooth with less than a gram of sugar.

  The chocolate peanut butter taste like reeses! I often use unsweetened almond milk for my protein shakes and before trying this brand I used to put a bit of stevia but with this protein powder is not even necessary.

  This tastes EXACTLY like the cereal.  Does not have a weird after taste like some powders do.  Even has some small sprinkle color things.  I typically just add with water as to use less dairy/ milk/ etc and still tastes great and mixes well.  I also like to add on top of cereal like rice krispies!

  I've been trying to find a good protein powder for a while now. One of my top priorities was a powder without that gross powdery taste. I was trying a few GNC Girl Scout cookie flavors, but they weren't really that great if I'm being honest. I read reviews saying this one tasted like cereal milk and it was on sale so I gave it a try. This powder tastes phenomenal! People weren't lying when they said it tasted like cereal milk it really does. I'm truly impressed with this Fruity Pebbles flavor and I can't wait to try other flavors from this company.

    Tastes like milk after cereal

  By far the most accurate protein powder flavor has been fruity pebbles. There's even little specs of the cereal in the powder. When I first got it I was drinking it like crazy, it's great in cold almond milk!The cocoa pebbles looks and smells like ordinary chocolate, underwhelming but the taste is still pretty accurate in milk. It's not like other chocolate powders which I personally do not care for, it's like a less extreme chocolate but still good. I'd rate fruity pebbles 5 stars and cocoa 4, the color and taste aren't as accurate as fruity pebbles which is surprising because I figured the fruity flavor would be more difficult to replicate. Would buy again

  I bought vanilla, and it tastes great. Can barely even tell it's a protein shake unlike other brands which leave a gross aftertaste. Mixes really easily and has plenty of quality protein. I really don't think you'll get much better for the price.

  Best protein powder I have tried. FRUITY PEBBELS ALL THE WAY. It's delicious and it works. So far I haven't had a problem with the quality of the powder and I've ordered it a few times now. Will continue to do so. A+ mess me up fruity pebbles.

    Only Half full

  I was excited to get this today. I have heard nothing but good things about this brand so I ordered it yesterday evening and it got here this afternoon which was awesome, 1 day free shipping but it is only halfway full it felt light when i took it out of the box i didnt remove the safety seal or open it but there is a little ""window"" on the back so you can see how much you have left and you can clearly see it is only halfway full. Really disappointing to recieve a half full product but i guess you get what you pay for. Havent tried it yet but only giving two stars because you are getting the amount if product as advertised.

  tastes just like fruity pebbles. Mixes very well in my cheap blender bottle. Only time will tell if it actually works. I work out a hour to a hour and a half 5 days a week so hopefully results will start showing soon.
