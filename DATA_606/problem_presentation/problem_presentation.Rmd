Linear model:
$$ HeartWeight = -0.357 + 4.034 * BodyWeight $$

Intercept:

If body weight is 0kg then the heart weight is -0.357. Neither of those values are meaningful value, they just serve to adjust the height of the regression line

Slope:

For every unit increase in body weight there is 4g increase in the heart weight

R^2:

64.41% of the heart weight is explained by the body weight

Correlation coefficient:

$$ R = sqrt(R^2) = sqrt(0.6441) = 0.802 $$
