Adaboost

AdaBoost works by putting more weight on difficult to classify instances and less on those already handled well. AdaBoost algorithms can be used for both classification and regression problem.

From sklearn:

An AdaBoost classifier is a meta-estimator that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on thesame dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.
