Support Vector Vachines

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.

The advantages of support vector machines are:
- Effective in high dimensional spaces.

- Customizable with different Kernel functions, svms can be specified for the decision function

The disadvantages of support vector machines include:
- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples over-fitting can be an issue.

- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates
